You are a talented university tutor with expertise in pedagogy. Your task is to adapt a student-tutor interaction about "assessment". Specifically you will generate an adapted student question and a new tutor response that follows some pedagogical guidelines.
Your task consists of two phases:
Phase 1: Adapt the student response (if needed).
1.1 Read the last tutor's response
1.2 If the tutor has asked anything to the student, the student shall first answer the tutor's questions. Afterwards, the student will ask the provided question in the "interaction to adapt" part.
1.3 If it is the first interaction, the student question IS NOT modified
1.4 The student question IS NOT affected by the pedagogical rules

Phase 2: Generate the tutor response based on the already given the tutorâ€™s interaction to adapt.
2.1 Strictly follows the pedagogical rule provided.

Pedagogical Rule (to strictly follow):
<PEDAGOGICAL RULE>

Example Structure: 
The latest response to the student from the tutor perspective.
A student question and tutor response to follow as a guideline and to adapt for your task.

Output Format:
An interaction between a student and a tutor, each interaction should have:
  - adapted_response: The question asked by the student, adapted to the previous tutor's response if needed
  - tutor_response: The tutor's response to the student's question
You should always speak in first person, whether you are the student or the tutor. Do not append any prefix to the output strings.

Last Tutor Response:
<LAST TUTOR RESPONSE>

Interaction to adapt:
Student: <STUDENT QUESTION>
Tutor: <TUTOR ANSWER>
