Additionally, instructors can strive to provide feedback that is specific, timely, and focused on the learner's goals and needs, rather than simply providing general praise or criticism. Finally, instructors can be mindful of the potential for feedback to create dependency or lead to frustration, and take steps to mitigate these risks, such as by providing scaffolded learning experiences and offering multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning."

Additionally, teachers can use different types of feedback, such as written comments, verbal feedback, or peer review, to help students understand their strengths and areas for improvement and to foster a growth mindset.\n\nTo reduce anxiety and negative emotions that may interfere with students' ability to engage with feedback, teachers can also consider incorporating more frequent, low-stakes assessments and providing opportunities for students to revise and resubmit work. This can help students feel more confident and motivated to learn, and can also help to reduce the perceived risk of failure.\n\nFurthermore, teachers can devote additional time to improving dialogue with students and making changes at a curriculum level to better support student learning. This can involve regularly meeting with students one-on-one to discuss their progress, providing opportunities for students to reflect on their own learning, and using formative assessments to monitor student progress and adjust instruction accordingly. By taking these steps, teachers can create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that encourages all students to engage with feedback and reach their full potential."

These categories were then supplemented and elaborated upon through emergent categories that arose from a close study of the teaching videos and assignments during the coding process. Each author examined the data sources for each teacher candidate to ensure investigator triangulation and reliability. Additionally, the researchers developed a case study template that examined the teacher candidates' teaching thematically through their artifacts in both the fall and spring semesters. The template included a description of the teaching context, followed by a look into the themes identified during the first stage of analysis, including teacher positioning/interaction patterns with students, eliciting, interpreting, and responding, and timing. The discussion of these themes was divided into sections on the fall and spring semesters and drew from relevant data collected in lesson plans, teaching videos, and reflections written after teaching the lesson. Finally, the researchers created a linkage chart to identify patterns within and across teacher candidates and over time, which assisted them in moving from themes to claims."

However, if assessment practices are overly focused on grading and comparison, they can undermine students' confidence by creating a culture of competition and evaluation, rather than collaboration and learning. Additionally, if students are constantly exposed to negative feedback or are led to believe that they are not capable of success, this can create a self-fulfilling prophecy and undermine their motivation to learn.

The researchers conducted an empirical cross-sectional study to examine two assumptions of their theoretical model.\n\nThe first assumption was that the perceived application of formative assessment is associated with students' motivation to learn. The researchers found that students' perceptions of the application of formative strategies by their teacher were indeed associated with their autonomous motivation. Specifically, students who experienced more teacher use of classroom discussions reported higher autonomous and higher controlled motivation. However, the results also showed that classroom discussions did not solely result in more autonomous motivation, and the way classroom discussions were applied by the teacher mattered.\n\nThe second assumption was that students' satisfaction of their basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness mediates the association between students' perceptions of formative assessment use and their autonomous motivation. The researchers found that students' satisfaction of these needs did not significantly mediate the relationship between formative assessment use and autonomous motivation.\n\nOverall, the researchers found that the use of formative assessment by teachers was beneficial for students' motivation, and that students who experienced more teacher use of formative strategies reported higher levels of autonomous and controlled motivation. However, the way classroom discussions were applied by the teacher mattered in terms of their impact on students' motivation."

Additionally, the moderation of teachers' judgments may be inadequate, as there is limited systematic form of moderator training and little is known about inter-moderator consistency (Johnson, 2011). Furthermore, teachers' assessments may not be comparable across different educators and institutions, which could limit their usefulness in high-stakes accountability systems."

This is reflected in the responses of trainees 1 and 3, who mentioned using AfL to test each learning outcome and planning lessons based on success criteria.\n* An instructional purpose that promotes self-reflection and motivation involves asking students to create questions to ask each other and probe their knowledge, as well as providing verbal feedback to help them reflect on their learning and improve. This is evident in the responses of trainees 5, 8, and 17.\n* Trainee teachers' assessment competence and literacy involves using verbal feedback and questioning more often, self-assessment to check progress, and using traffic light or color-coded multiple-choice questions to make it easier to notice misconceptions. This is reflected in the responses of trainees 4 and 9.\n* Reviewing students' learning involves using differentiated questioning, allowing students to act on feedback to address areas for improvement, and using the outcomes of AfL to plan and adapt lessons to meet the needs of students.

      "content": "One potential limitation of using formative assessment with SRS is that peer discussion prompts may lead to incorrect reasonings or discussions of ideas that do not relate to the answer options of the multiple-choice questions. Additionally, showing voting results before peer discussion prompts can bias students' discussions and reduce the diagnosticity of comprehension cues. To address these limitations, the author suggests complementing peer discussion prompts with teacher feedback prompts. Another approach is to use automatic assessment systems that not only provide feedback on learning outcomes but also provide feedback on the quality of cues and metacognitive judgments. The author also notes that metacognition is a recent area of research in formative assessment with SRS that is not yet well understood, and that further empirical studies are needed to validate the framework and explore its applicability to other systems."

It is based on a qualitative study of 176 students in six UK schools and further education colleges and three universities. The DFC model includes three phases: forethought, performance, and self-reflection. It addresses the issue of end-loading assessment feedback by providing feedback throughout the entire process, rather than just at the end. This helps students to understand the criteria and expectations of the assignment, improve their assessment literacy, and develop self-regulated learning skills."

Variety in assessment methods: It is important to incorporate a range of assessment methods to cater to different learning styles and engage students in the learning process. Assessments should be designed to provide formative feedback that helps students identify areas for improvement and guides their learning.\n2. Balance between formative and summative assessments: A balance between formative and summative assessments is essential for effective learning. Summative assessments should be used to evaluate student learning at the end of a module or course, while formative assessments should be used throughout the learning process to provide feedback and guide student progress.\n3. Timely and targeted feedback: Providing timely, targeted, and consistent feedback to students is crucial for effective learning. Feedback should be linked to specific learning objectives and should help students understand their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, feedback should be provided regularly, not just at the end of a module or course.\n\nBy focusing on these three themes, educational programs can create a more supportive and effective learning environment that promotes deep learning and student success."

      "content": "Combining formative and summative assessments in education can have several benefits, such as providing a more comprehensive understanding of student learning and enabling teachers to adjust their instruction to better support student progress. However, there are also challenges to consider, including differences in the purpose and criteria of formative and summative assessments, the need for coherence between assessment criteria, and time constraints.\n\nOne challenge is the \"didactic contract\" between teachers and students, where the reciprocal expectations of the teacher and students differ depending on how the teacher uses the students' productions to make judgments. Another challenge is ensuring coherence between the criteria involved in summative and formative assessments, and with what is taught. This requires a long back-and-forth analysis between teaching goals, knowledge, and competencies, and how they are involved in effective teaching and assessment.\n\nTo address these challenges, professional development opportunities can be beneficial. These opportunities can include training on how to use formative assessments to inform instruction and improve student learning, as well as how to align formative and summative assessments to ensure coherence. Additionally, professional development can help teachers develop strategies for managing the \"didactic contract\" and balancing the need for formative and summative assessments within the context of teaching and learning. By providing teachers with these opportunities, educators can enhance the combination of formative and summative assessments and promote more effective teaching and learning."

Internally, the teacher's personal practice assessment theories (PPATs) play a significant role in determining the types of formative assessment strategies used. For example, if a teacher has a learner-centered PPAT, they are more likely to use formative assessment processes that are congruent with the tenets of formative assessment, such as frequent and effective use of formative assessment strategies.\n\nExternally, contextual elements such as the curriculum, school culture, and available resources can also impact the use of formative assessment strategies. For instance, if a teacher is working in a school with a strong emphasis on standardized testing, they may feel pressured to focus more on summative assessments and less on formative ones. Similarly, if a teacher lacks access to technology or other resources, they may have limited ability to implement certain formative assessment strategies.\n\nAdditionally, the teacher's reflection on their own practice and the subsequent modification of their assessment processes are critical factors in the use of formative assessment strategies. Teachers who reflect on their practice and make changes based on that reflection are more likely to use formative assessment effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of formative assessment strategies in the classroom is influenced by a complex interplay of internal and external factors. Understanding these factors can help educators develop a deeper appreciation for the challenges and opportunities of implementing formative assessment in the classroom."

The emotive potential of a feedback interaction can also inhibit productive and meaningful conversations that promote extension of learning (Carless et al., 2011). Overly critical feedback can have damaging impacts on the quality of learning in the moment and into the future (Henderson et al., 2005).

This limited approach to understanding student ideas may have hindered the development of more responsive teaching practices. To improve their teaching, teacher candidates might benefit from recognizing and valuing a broader range of student ideas, and incorporating them into their lessons in a more intentional and purposeful way."

Firstly, they can avoid dichotomizing students' ideas by recognizing that understanding is a continuous spectrum and that students may have varying degrees of comprehension. Secondly, teachers can consider the nuances of student understanding by analyzing the responses more deeply and looking for evidence of students' thought processes. Finally, teachers can avoid misinterpreting students' actions as defiant or lacking comprehension, instead, they can view them as opportunities to learn more about the students' thinking and understanding. By taking these steps, teachers can gain a more accurate picture of students' understanding and provide more effective feedback to support their learning."

Feedback: Feedback should be an integral part of the assessment process, and students should be able to use it to inform their learning and demonstrate improvement.\n4. Self-arranged feedback: Students should be able to arrange their own feedback and determine when it is complete, rather than relying solely on teachers or instructors.\n5. Emphasis on discernment and handling of relevant aspects: The assessment tasks should focus on evaluating students' ability to discern and handle the relevant aspects of problems or issues, rather than simply recalling information.\n6. Integration of disciplinary and professional knowledge: Assessment tasks should require students to draw upon both disciplinary and professional knowledge to solve real-world problems.\n7. Future-oriented: Assessment tasks should be designed to prepare students for future challenges, rather than simply measuring their current knowledge or skills."

Internally, a teacher's personal practice assessment theories (PPATs) play a significant role in determining the types of formative assessment strategies they use. For instance, if a teacher has a learner-centered PPAT, they are more likely to use formative assessment processes that are congruent with the tenets of formative assessment, such as frequent and effective use of formative assessment processes and strategies. Additionally, the teacher's reflection on their assessment practices can also impact their use of formative assessment.\n\nExternally, contextual elements such as the curriculum, instructional materials, and school culture can also influence a teacher's use of formative assessment. For example, if the curriculum emphasizes standardized testing, this may constrain a teacher's ability to use formative assessment practices that are not aligned with these standards. Similarly, if the school culture values traditional teaching methods, this may discourage teachers from using more innovative or student-centered approaches to assessment.\n\nMoreover, the interaction between internal and external contextual elements can also affect a teacher's use of formative assessment. For instance, a teacher who has a learner-centered PPAT may still face constraints on their ability to use formative assessment effectively due to external contextual elements such as limited resources or time constraints.\n\nOverall, the use of formative assessment in the classroom is influenced by a complex interplay of internal and external factors, and understanding these factors can provide valuable insights into how to support effective assessment practices in the classroom."

Additionally, there may be concerns about fairness and reliability of grading, grade inflation, and honors classification, which can lead to a focus on these issues rather than on promoting student learning. Another challenge is the preoccupation of middle and senior managers with quality assurance aspects of assessment, such as preventing and managing malpractice, rather than encouraging diverse or innovative approaches to assessment.\n\nMoreover, the widespread implementation of AfL at course levels may be difficult to gauge, and there may be limited research on the impact of AfL on university assessment policies. Moreover, the issue of feedback is a critical aspect of AfL, but it can be challenging to provide timely and constructive feedback to students, especially in large classes.\n\nFurthermore, there may be a lack of resources, such as time, funding, and professional development opportunities, to support the implementation of AfL. Teachers may also need support in developing their assessment skills and understanding of AfL principles. Finally, there may be resistance from staff and students who are used to traditional assessment methods and may be hesitant to adopt new approaches."

They interviewed each participant three times over the course of the study using a semi-structured interview protocol.\n\nTo observe the participants' formative assessment practices, the researchers used the Candidate Preservice Assessment of Student Teaching (CPAST), which is a formative and summative evaluation tool that measures teacher candidates' pedagogical knowledge/skills and professional dispositions during the student teaching practicum. The CPAST is a valid and reliable observation tool, and the teacher participants were familiar with its structure as they had previously used it during their clinical experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers administered a teacher effectiveness survey at the beginning and end of the study, basing questions on the Silver Strong teacher effectiveness framework. The survey asked participants to self-assess their effectiveness for various indicators on a 1-4 rating scale.\n\nFinally, the researchers collected de-identified assessment data from all teacher participants, including universal screening data (e.g., state reading assessment, i-Ready, easyCBM) and teacher-created classroom assessments (e.g., quizzes, homework, exit tickets, worksheets, journal entries, Seesaw activities, Google Surveys, Google Doc assignments)."

Firstly, research has shown that students tend to ignore comments when grades are also given, suggesting that grades can actually hinder the learning process. By providing feedback solely through comments, teachers can ensure that students are engaging more productively with their work. Additionally, providing comments rather than grades can help to focus parents' attention on the learning issues rather than the score or grade, and can help to reduce the emphasis on competition and comparison among students. Finally, providing comments can help to enhance the learning process by encouraging students to reflect on their work and identify areas for improvement."

These control variables could include the learner's subjective representation of competencies, the related standards, and the task requirements.\n2. Assessment of the current state of control variables: To ensure effective control, the model requires an assessment component for both the internal and external feedback loops. This involves evaluating the current state of the control variables, such as the learner's competence level, against the desired level of competence.\n3. Processing of feedback information: The third component of a successful control mechanism is the processing of feedback information. Both the internal and external feedback sources must compare the current state of competencies to the desired level of competencies, and use the result of this comparison to generate control actions. This ensures that the learner receives accurate and timely feedback on their progress, which can then be used to adjust their learning strategies and improve their performance."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Formative assessments can be designed to improve metacognitive awareness in students by incorporating diagnostic cues that signal the cognitive demands of the course and the quality of their cognitive states. There are two types of cues that can be used: comprehension cues and course demands cues.\n\nComprehension cues are information that indicates the knowledge and quality of cognitive states, such as the amount of clues and information recognized when reading a question or discussing it with peers, or the number of multiple-choice questions correctly answered in an assessment. These cues can help students become more aware of their understanding of the course material and apply metacognitive skills. For example, prompts in formative assessments can improve the accuracy of monitoring judgments and indicate comprehension of tasks and topics.\n\nCourse demands cues, on the other hand, are information that makes students aware of what is expected during the course, such as the type of posed questions, the level of abstraction, the difficulty of the questions, and the skills or solution strategies needed to answer them. These cues can help students recognize the importance of certain questions and adjust their solution strategies accordingly. Repeated exposure to similar questions and the teacher's emphasis on solution strategies can also inform students of the most important course content and the significance of these questions in summative assessments.\n\nTo incorporate these cues into formative assessments, instructors can use a variety of techniques, such as providing explicit information about the cognitive demands of the course, using multiple-choice questions with different levels of difficulty, and providing feedback on students' responses. Additionally, prompts can be used to guide students' attention to the relevant information and promote metacognitive awareness. By incorporating these cues into formative assessments, instructors can help students develop metacognitive skills and become more aware of their own learning processes."

Firstly, the introduction of a national curriculum for all schools in England and Wales in 1988 led to the adoption of a model of age-independent levels of achievement that was too coarse-grained to be directly useful in classroom teaching. Secondly, the requirement for a system of ten levels to cover the age range of 5 to 16, arranged so that the average student could be expected to achieve one level every two years, was too fine-grained for practical use. Finally, assuring comparability of awards, both between schools and with other traditionally-based awards, required costly administration. These three factors, combined with the introduction of a new system of GCSE exams that included a written, end-of-course examination, ultimately led to the abandonment of the graded assessment schemes by 1995."

This helps to shift the focus away from their own abilities and onto external circumstances beyond their control. Additionally, students may use the teacher's third position prompt for elaboration as an opportunity to provide contextualizing accounts, rather than further assessments. By doing so, they can legitimize their self-assessments while also avoiding potential negative evaluation from the teacher. Finally, students may use self-deprecating language or humor to deflect attention away from their perceived strengths and towards their weaknesses, thereby avoiding praise or positive evaluation.

Teachers' roles as authority figures and evaluators of student performance can create a power imbalance that discourages students from expressing their own assessments or opinions. Additionally, using open-ended questions in the classroom may not always result in self-reflection or self-assessment, as students may feel they are being evaluated or judged. Finally, conventional approaches to fostering student reflection and self-assessment may not be effective, as students may resist or withhold their assessments due to fear of being incorrect or failing to meet expectations."

Formative assessment activities, such as peer assessment and other formative activities, can provide valuable feedback to both teachers and students, allowing them to adjust their instruction and learning strategies accordingly. Additionally, formative assessment can help teachers identify areas where students may need additional support or scaffolding, and can inform the development of more effective teaching methods.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges associated with implementing formative assessment. Teachers may need additional training and support to effectively integrate formative assessment into their teaching practices, particularly in large classes or in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) contexts. Additionally, formative assessment requires adequate time and flexibility to be successfully implemented, and may be difficult to incorporate into existing teaching schedules or curricula. Moreover, teachers may face challenges in obtaining accurate and reliable data from formative assessments, particularly if they are not familiar with the assessment methods being used. To address these challenges, it is important for teachers to receive ongoing professional development and support, and for schools and institutions to prioritize the integration of formative assessment into their teaching and learning practices."

On the one hand, rubrics can facilitate student learning by providing clear and transparent criteria for evaluation, allowing students to receive constructive feedback and understand expectations. This can lead to increased learning-oriented strategies and improved performance. Additionally, rubrics can help reduce anxiety and negative self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, as students feel more in control of their learning and can better plan and monitor their progress.\n\nHowever, the use of rubrics can also have potential drawbacks. For example, students may experience increased stress and performance anxiety due to the pressure of meeting explicit criteria. This can lead to a focus on \"criteria compliance\" rather than productive learning, as seen in the extreme case described by Torrance (2007). Moreover, rubrics may not necessarily increase learning-oriented SRL, as some students may still rely on performance- and avoidance-oriented strategies even when given clear criteria. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the implementation of rubrics in student assessments to ensure that they promote productive learning and minimize potential negative effects."

Prevalence of high summative assessment diets and lack of formative assessment.\n3. Episodic and haphazard feedback that does not connect to the next task or across modules.\n\nExamples of best practices for implementing these themes in educational programs include:\n\n1. Using a variety of assessment methods and formats to cater to different learning styles and needs, such as written exams, oral presentations, group projects, and online quizzes. This can help to reduce the reliance on high-stakes summative assessments and promote more frequent, lower-stakes formative assessments.\n2. Incorporating formative assessments into the learning process, such as through regular quizzes or class discussions, to provide students with ongoing feedback and opportunities to reflect on their progress. This can help to foster a deeper understanding of the material and encourage students to take ownership of their learning.\n3. Providing feedback that is specific, timely, and connected to the next task or module, such as through the use of rubrics or peer review. This can help to ensure that students receive meaningful feedback that they can use to improve their performance, rather than generic or unhelpful feedback that does not provide any guidance.\n\nOverall, the key to implementing best practices in formative assessment is to prioritize the use of multiple, varied assessment methods, provide ongoing feedback that is specific and connected to the learning objectives, and create a culture of continuous improvement and self-reflection among students. By doing so, educators can promote deeper learning and more effective feedback, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of education for their students."

Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on how and when formative assessment should be offered, and how to evaluate and monitor students' learning progress in complex contexts.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have recommended the use of dynamic, continuous frameworks for evaluating performance that promote students' progress and the mastery of increasingly sophisticated skills. These frameworks should take into account the interconnectedness of different knowledge and competencies, and should be able to accommodate the complexity of real-life problem-solving situations. Moreover, the use of technology-based assessment tools and the incorporation of authentic tasks and scenarios can provide more accurate and comprehensive measures of students' learning outcomes. Finally, ongoing professional development for teachers and educators is crucial to ensure that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively implement formative assessment practices in the classroom."

Secondly, the facilitator's use of a long pause before targeting a specific student to respond allows for a sense of anticipation and encourages the students to engage in self-reflection. Additionally, the facilitator's gaze sweeping over the group before focusing on a particular student creates a sense of inclusivity and equal participation.\n\nMoreover, the facilitator's framing of the question in terms of \"what could get better\" rather than \"what went well\" or \"what needs improvement\" also encourages negative self-assessment. This is because the former phrase emphasizes the potential for growth and development, rather than reinforcing existing strengths or accomplishments. Furthermore, the facilitator's use of open-ended language such as \"l\u00e5t oss prata lite om\" (\"let's talk a little bit about\") and \"ja\" (\"yes\") creates a relaxed and inviting atmosphere, which may make it easier for students to share their negative experiences.\n\nOverall, the facilitator's communication strategies in this scenario are designed to create a safe and supportive environment where students feel comfortable sharing their negative experiences and engaging in self-reflection. By using a combination of inclusive language, open-ended questions, and a relaxed tone, the facilitator encourages students to focus on their own learning and development, rather than comparing themselves to others or feeling judged."

      "content": "The teacher's use of formative assessment practices supported the students' development of self-regulated learning skills in several ways. First, the teacher's frequent use of all-response systems and small tests allowed him to gather information about students' knowledge and skills in relation to the learning goals, and use this information to provide targeted feedback. This helped students to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and to set realistic learning goals for themselves.\n\nSecond, the teacher's use of the \"Invisible cloak\" and other feedback strategies helped students to develop their self-assessment skills, by providing them with information about their own learning and encouraging them to reflect on their progress. This helped students to become more aware of their own learning processes, and to take greater responsibility for their own learning.\n\nFinally, the teacher's use of formative assessment practices helped to create a supportive learning environment, where students felt safe to take risks and make mistakes. This allowed students to develop their self-regulatory skills in a low-stakes setting, and to build confidence in their ability to learn and succeed."

      "content": "There are several potential benefits of using digital formative assessment tools in primary school education. Firstly, digital formative assessment tools can provide verification feedback to students, summary and individual feedback to teachers, and adaptive lessons based on student performance. This can lead to improved mathematics achievement and motivation, as found by Faber et al. (2017) in their study on the use of Snappet, a digital formative assessment tool. Additionally, digital formative assessment tools can enable teachers to contribute to ePortfolios on a more regular basis, which can be beneficial for both teachers and parents, as found by Hooker (2017) in their study on the use of ePortfolios in an Australian special education context. Furthermore, the use of digital formative assessment tools can facilitate the incorporation of formative assessment into curriculum units, as shown by Vogelzang and Admiraal (2017) in their action research study on the incorporation of formative assessment into a chemistry class in the Netherlands. Finally, digital formative assessment tools can provide insights into the effectiveness of formative assessment practices, as demonstrated by Pinger et al. (2018) in their study on the relationship between the quality of formative assessment practice, student achievement, and student interest in a German 9th grade unit on the Pythagorean Theorem."

      "content": "Developing staff assessment and feedback literacy is crucial for effective assessment and feedback practices in higher education. One effective way to develop staff assessment literacy is through professional development opportunities that focus on assessment and feedback pedagogy. This could include workshops, seminars, and online training programs that provide educators with the knowledge and skills necessary to design, implement, and evaluate meaningful assessments and feedback mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, staff assessment literacy can help seed student assessment literacy in several ways. Firstly, when educators have a deep understanding of assessment and feedback principles, they can design assessments that align with learning objectives and promote student engagement and motivation. Secondly, educators can provide explicit and timely feedback to students that helps them understand their strengths and weaknesses, set goals, and improve their learning outcomes. Finally, by modeling effective assessment and feedback practices, educators can foster a culture of assessment literacy among their students, encouraging them to take ownership of their learning and become more self-regulated learners.\n\nTo scale up these practices, institutions can consider embedding assessment literacy training into their professional development programs for all educators, including faculty, instructors, and teaching assistants. Additionally, institutions can create a community of practice where educators can share their experiences, challenges, and successes in implementing assessment and feedback practices, providing a space for collaborative learning and continuous improvement. By prioritizing staff assessment literacy and its impact on student learning, institutions can create a culture of assessment that supports student success and fosters a love of learning."
