      "content": "The main challenges and barriers to scaling up Assessment for Learning (AfL) in higher education institutions include:\n\n1. Powerful imperatives surrounding summative assessment and grading: There remains a strong emphasis on summative assessment and grading in higher education institutions, which can overpower learning-oriented approaches to assessment. This includes concerns about fairness and reliability of grading, grade inflation, and honors classification, as well as student malpractices such as plagiarism or other forms of cheating.\n2. Preoccupation with quality assurance aspects of assessment: Middle and senior managers are often more concerned with quality assurance aspects of assessment, such as preventing and managing malpractice, rather than encouraging diverse or innovative approaches to assessment.\n3. Limited implementation of AfL: Despite the recognized benefits of AfL, its implementation is limited, and there is a lack of widespread adoption of AfL practices across different geographical locations and courses.\n4. Lack of understanding of AfL: Some educators may not fully understand the principles and benefits of AfL, which can hinder its implementation and scaling up.\n5. Resistance to change: Changing assessment practices can be challenging, and some educators may resist adopting new approaches to assessment, especially if they have been using traditional methods for a long time.\n6. Time and resource constraints: Implementing and scaling up AfL requires significant time and resources, which can be a barrier for institutions with limited resources or tight budgets.\n7. Technological challenges: Implementing technology-enhanced assessment methods can be challenging, particularly for institutions with limited technological infrastructure or resources.\n8. Need for support and professional development: Educators may require additional support and professional development to effectively implement AfL practices, which can be a challenge for institutions with limited resources or competing priorities.\n\nOverall, these challenges and barriers can make it difficult to scale up AfL in higher education institutions, but addressing them can help to facilitate the adoption of AfL practices and improve student learning outcomes."

      "content": "Educators can employ various methods to facilitate students' self-assessment during authentic evaluation episodes. One technique is to ask open-ended questions that encourage general assessment without specifying a target. Another method is to use specific questions that lean toward positive or negative evaluations. Structured prompts or rubrics can also guide students' self-assessment and provide more nuanced feedback. By creating a supportive and inclusive environment, educators can help students take ownership of their learning and engage in constructive self-assessment."

Firstly, they struggled to define the field of formative assessment and identify relevant key words for their search. They also found that the lack of consensus on appropriate key words led to inconsistent results when using databases such as ERIC and citation indexes. Additionally, they noted that many studies did not provide sufficient details to calculate standardized effect sizes, which made it difficult to combine results from different studies using meta-analysis. Finally, the authors recognized that the relatively weak theorization of the field made it inappropriate to specify inclusion criteria and instead chose to use a best evidence synthesis approach, which is subjective and not replicable."

(2014) used their machine-learning-based feedback system to provide immediate feedback to students on their constructed text responses. This allowed students to receive feedback on their work before submitting it for grading, enabling them to improve their performance and achieve better learning outcomes. Similarly, Chen and Chen (2009) used their sequential data-mining techniques to make learning recommendations to students based on their performance history. This allowed instructors to provide targeted feedback to students who needed it most, helping to guide their learning and improve their overall performance. Overall, automated feedback systems have the potential to revolutionize the way formative assessment is conducted in online learning environments, providing timely and personalized feedback to students that can help them stay on track and achieve their learning goals."

This approach involves providing students with ongoing feedback throughout the learning process, rather than waiting until the end of the course to deliver feedback. By doing so, students can receive feedback that is more relevant and useful to their learning, and they can use this feedback to improve their performance in a timely manner.\n\nAnother strategy is to reposition feedback as a fundamental component of curriculum design rather than a marking and grading routine. This approach emphasizes the importance of feedback in the learning process and recognizes that feedback is not just about providing information to students, but also about helping them to develop their skills and understanding. By integrating feedback into the curriculum design, educators can create a culture of continuous improvement and learning.\n\nFinally, using group assessment as a mode of alternative assessment can also help to address student concerns about timeliness. Group assessment can provide students with the opportunity to work collaboratively and learn from one another, while also receiving feedback from their peers and instructors. By incorporating group assessment into the learning process, educators can provide students with more frequent and timely feedback, which can help to improve their learning outcomes.\n\nOverall, these strategies can help to address student concerns about the timeliness of feedback in higher education by providing students with more frequent and relevant feedback, and by recognizing the importance of feedback in the learning process. By implementing these strategies, educators can create a more effective and supportive learning environment for their students."

If students answer an isomorphic question correctly, it indicates that they have a good understanding of the concept (Zingaro & Porter, 2014). On the other hand, if students answer an isomorphic question incorrectly, it suggests that they may need further learning or review of the concept (Zingaro & Porter, 2014). Additionally, isomorphic questions can help students to engage in meaningful metacognitive reflection, as they require students to compare and contrast different questions and identify commonalities and differences (Gick & \u00b4es Holyoak, 1983)."

Mini-whiteboards allowed him to collect information about every student's learning during a lesson, while exit passes provided information about every individual student's understanding at the end of the lesson. Additionally, Fredric used a conscious selection of tasks based on a diagnosis made or information gathered in other ways. He would sometimes select tasks based on a student's request and sometimes based on his own initiative. Furthermore, he replaced scores with comments on homework and diagnostic tests, providing additional feedback to his students. Finally, he used a specific feedback strategy called \"two stars and a wish,\" where he would communicate two things the students had done well and one specific suggestion for improvement. These strategies allowed Fredric to gather valuable information about his students' learning needs and adjust his instruction accordingly."

One challenge is that these strategies are often based on the assumption that responsibility for change lies with academics who plan assessment, which may limit the scope of potential interventions (Cramp et al., 2012). Additionally, there may be concerns about increasing academic workload and resource constraints (Nicol et al., 2014). Moreover, some lecturers may perceive that student engagement with feedback is limited (Price et al., 2010), which could reduce the motivation of teachers to invest time and effort in providing feedback to students.\n\nTo address these challenges, formal and informal communities of practice and other teaching peer or personal networks can be leveraged to support staff in implementing change (Storrs, 2012). Building knowledge and skills, as well as offering emotional support, can help to overcome these challenges. For instance, training programs and workshops can be organized to enhance teaching skills and promote the use of formative assessment strategies. Additionally, mentoring programs can be established to provide emotional support and guidance to teachers who are trying to implement new assessment methods. By addressing these challenges, educators can create more effective and engaging learning environments that foster student success."

Specifically, they started with predetermined categories based on the literature, such as providing opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding, identifying students' ideas, interpreting students' responses, and responding to students' ideas. These categories were then supplemented and elaborated upon through emergent codes that arose from a close study of the teaching videos and assignments.\n\nNext, the researchers developed a case study template to guide their analysis of each teacher candidate's artifacts, including lesson plans, teaching videos, and reflections. This template included a description of the teaching context and a look at the themes identified during the initial round of coding, such as teacher positioning/interaction patterns with students, eliciting, interpreting, and responding, and timing. The researchers also used a linkage chart to identify patterns within and across teacher candidates and over time, allowing them to move from themes to claims.\n\nOverall, the researchers used a combination of predetermined and emergent coding, as well as a structured case study template and linkage chart, to systematically examine teacher candidates' formative assessment practices in this comparative case study."

      "content": "The purpose of the analysis of effect sizes is to determine whether the effect sizes are homogeneous or heterogeneous across different studies. The analysis is performed using a fixed effects method, which involves calculating a weighted mean effect size and a test for heterogeneity of effect sizes. The test for heterogeneity is based on the Q statistic, which has an approximate chi-square distribution with k-1 degrees of freedom, where k is the number of independent effect sizes. If the value of the Q statistic exceeds the critical chi-square value, it indicates that there is significant heterogeneity among the effect sizes, and the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effect sizes is rejected.\n\nThe result of this analysis is indicated by the value of the Q statistic and the I2 statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. If the Q statistic is statistically significant, it suggests that the effect sizes are heterogeneous, and the weighted average effect size may not be a reliable estimate of the population effect size. On the other hand, if the Q statistic is not statistically significant, it suggests that the effect sizes are homogeneous, and the weighted average effect size can be considered an estimate of the population effect size. The I2 statistic provides information about the proportion of variability in the effect sizes that is due to heterogeneity, and can be used to determine the degree of heterogeneity present in the data."

The researcher used Welch's t-test to test for statistical significance of the differences and calculated Hedges' g as a measure of the size of the effects. Additionally, the researcher identified changes in the students' self-regulated learning (SRL) practice through an analysis of observation data and teacher and student interviews. The researcher noted students' actions, observed or described, that could be identified as any of the skills described in Zimmerman's three self-regulation phases (Forethought, Performance, and Self-reflection) and categorized them according to Zimmerman's four proficiency levels of regulatory skills (Observation, Emulation, Self-control, and Self-regulation). The researcher also analyzed the learning activities regularly implemented by the teacher to enhance students' self-regulated learning, and identified aspects of formative assessment in these activities using Black and Wiliam's (2009) definition. Finally, the researcher used Zimmerman's model of self-regulated learning (2000) and Nicol & Macfarlane-Dick's (2006) seven principles to analyze how the characteristics of the teacher's formative assessment practice may have affected the students' self-regulated learning."

Research has shown that this type of feedback can be more efficient and effective than traditional written feedback, as it allows for the use of multimedia elements such as gestures and intonation to convey information and support student understanding.

Technology can play a crucial role in supporting these practices by providing authentic contexts for assessment through simulations and virtual worlds, and by enabling the use of context-based tasks that help students develop as effective lifelong assessors.\n\nOne strategy for implementing sustainable assessment practices is to use online learning environments that are designed to develop assessment skills and focus on professional situations. These environments can provide students with opportunities to practice both their domain-specific and assessment skills while taking into account the complexity of the task and the level of instructional support provided.\n\nAnother strategy is to use collaborative review and assessment processes that involve students, peers, and tutors in a critical examination of work. This can be achieved through face-to-face interviews, online discussions, and questionnaires, which provide a critical supportive perspective and offer students the necessary criteria to make judgments on their work.\n\nTechnology can also be used to support formative assessment and feedback, which is essential for focused learning. For example, ICT tools can be used to provide students with immediate feedback on their performance, enabling them to monitor and manage their own learning more effectively. Additionally, technology can facilitate the use of rubrics and other assessment criteria, making it easier for faculty and students to understand and apply them.\n\nOverall, the use of technology in sustainable assessment practices can enhance the effectiveness of assessment for learning, promote student engagement and motivation, and support the development of lifelong assessment skills."

Asking students to \"traffic light\" a list of key words or topics before a test to stimulate reflection on their learning and identify areas where they need to focus their efforts.\n2. Having students mark each other's test papers in peer groups, using a self-created marking rubric, to encourage critical thinking and deepen understanding of the material.\n3. Encouraging students to generate and answer their own test questions, which helps to develop an overview of the topic and improves learning outcomes. This approach has been found to be effective based on research studies such as those conducted by Foos et al. (1994) and King (1992)."

Finally, the researchers prioritized the use of feedback in a pedagogy focused on learning, which was a departure from bureaucratic measures such as target-setting. These differences in approach contributed to the success of the research and practice initiative and shifted the balance of the arguments in the debate about how policy should secure optimum synergy between teachers' formative, teachers' summative, and external assessments."

This information should be shared with students and used to guide their learning.\n2. Engineering effective classroom discussions and other learning tasks that elicit evidence of student understanding: This strategy involves designing activities that encourage students to engage actively with the material and provide evidence of their understanding. These activities could include group discussions, problem-solving exercises, or interactive simulations.\n3. Providing feedback that moves learners forward: This strategy involves providing timely and targeted feedback to students based on their performance. The feedback should be designed to help students identify areas for improvement and take action to address them.\n4. Activating students as instructional resources: This strategy involves using students as a resource for one another's learning. This could involve peer review, cooperative learning, or other forms of collaborative learning.\n5. Activating students as the owners of their own learning: This strategy involves empowering students to take ownership of their own learning. This could involve giving them choices about what they learn, how they learn it, and how they demonstrate their understanding.\n\nBy incorporating these five strategies into digital learning environments, educators can create a more dynamic and personalized learning experience for their students."

This approach can help students to identify and correct their mistakes without becoming overly reliant on the feedback, and can promote deeper learning and understanding of the material. Additionally, using this approach can help to prevent the fossilization of errors and misconceptions, as students are encouraged to actively engage with the material and reflect on their own learning. To implement this pattern effectively, instructors can use a variety of assessment types, such as multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, and open-ended questions, and can provide detailed feedback indicating the source and type of each error, without revealing exactly what must be done to correct them. By using this approach, instructors can create a supportive learning environment that fosters student engagement, motivation, and learning."

Specifically, the results of the independent sample t-test showed that the academic performance of students in the experimental group in schema construction and schema proficiency was significantly higher than that of the control group. Additionally, the study found that formative assessment reduced the academic gap between students and promoted students' complex skill learning. However, the study did not find a significant difference in students' knowledge mastery between the experimental and control groups.\n\nExplanation: The study found that formative assessment was effective in improving students' complex skill learning by providing students with opportunities to practice and apply their knowledge in a supportive learning environment. The results of the t-test showed that students in the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in schema construction and schema proficiency, which suggests that formative assessment helped students to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and to apply their knowledge more effectively. Furthermore, the study found that formative assessment reduced the academic gap between students, indicating that it was effective in promoting equal learning opportunities for all students. However, the study did not find a significant difference in students' knowledge mastery between the experimental and control groups, suggesting that formative assessment may not have a significant impact on students' factual knowledge."

They then controlled for possible differences in prior achievement by using \"input\" measures such as school test scores from the previous year or other measures of aptitude. Additionally, they used a standardized effect size measure, calculated by taking the difference between the scores of the experimental and control groups and dividing it by the standard deviation of the scores. This allowed them to compare the results across different grades and subjects. The researchers found that the average effect size was around 0.3 standard deviations, which would raise a school in the lower quartile of the national performance tables to well above average.

However, the implicit purpose of assessment is often related to the values and goals of the educational institution and the broader society. For instance, assessments may be used to communicate what is considered important in a particular subject or discipline, transmit cultural norms, and shape student identities and behaviors.\n\nRecognizing the double duty of assessment is crucial because it allows educators to design assessments that not only measure learning outcomes but also promote deeper learning and equipped students for lifelong learning.

      "content": "The teachers faced several challenges when using generic taxonomies to guide formative assessment in their classrooms. Firstly, the taxonomies were too abstract and far from subject practice, making it difficult to apply them in real-life teaching situations. Secondly, the categories were too broad and did not fit well with the subject-specific logic of teaching and learning. This resulted in a significant amount of time being spent on constructing progression steps for each lesson or sequence, which took away from the overall structure of the lessons and made it difficult to maintain an overview. Additionally, the emphasis on specific competencies and performance-oriented assessment led to a loss of focus on the joy of learning and the development of curiosity."

      "content": "There are four distinct stages of developing SRL skills: observation, emulation, self-control, and self-regulation. Educators can facilitate students' growth in these areas by offering suitable guidance, feedback, and chances for practice and reflection. For instance, at the observation stage, educators might demonstrate how to execute a talent and explain why, when, and how to apply it. During the emulation phase, teachers can give students feedback and encouragement while they practice the ability. Students must hone their abilities in controlled circumstances outside the existence of a model before they can reach the self-control stage. Finally, at the self-regulation stage, students can modify their approach in light of shifting individual and environmental factors. By giving students chances to practice and assess their techniques, educators can help them acquire these skills and eventually become more competent and independent learners."

Increased responsibility for learning: Self-assessment fosters a sense of responsibility among students for their own learning, as they are actively engaged in evaluating their progress and setting goals for improvement.\n5. Time allocation: While self-assessment requires a significant amount of time for feedback, it is important to take this into account when allocating workloads for teachers.\n6. Limited suitability for all courses: Self-assessment may not be suitable for all courses, especially those that focus solely on summative evaluation. However, combining formative evaluation with self-assessment can be beneficial for students.\n7. Importance of involving preservice teachers in the assessment process: Involving preservice teachers in the assessment process can foster their skills of self-assessment and promote their responsibility for learning."

In contrast, in the spring, all except one teacher candidate planned lessons in which parts of it were spent circulating and consulting with smaller groups of students. This allowed the teacher to move around the room and work with groups, ask clarifying questions, and make herself available for students to ask questions of their own. As a result, the teacher was able to elicit understandings from a greater number of students and have conversations regarding key concepts in a smaller environment more conducive for multiple students to both share their ideas and ask clarifying questions. Additionally, the teacher's physical positioning allowed her to find patterns in student ideas across the classroom, enabling her to respond in the moment and address common misconceptions."

The author suggests that traditional models of feedback, where tutors provide feedback to individual students, are not scalable and do not effectively promote student engagement and understanding. Instead, the author advocates for a process of formative peer feedback, where students provide feedback to one another on their work, under the guidance of tutors.\n\nThe author suggests that this approach can address issues of scalability by allowing students to provide feedback to one another, rather than relying solely on tutors to provide feedback. This can be particularly useful in large classes or online learning environments, where it may be difficult for tutors to provide individualized feedback to every student. Additionally, the author notes that formative peer feedback can promote deeper learning and understanding, as students must engage with one another's work and provide constructive feedback in order to improve their own performance.\n\nTo implement this approach successfully, the author suggests that students must be trained to provide effective feedback, and that tutors must design assessment tasks that allow for valid formative feedback at suitable points. The author also notes that there may be resistance to change from some tutors, but that the benefits of this approach far outweigh the challenges. Overall, the author argues that formative peer feedback is a valuable tool for promoting student learning and improving assessment processes in higher education, and that it has the potential to drive positive change in the culture of higher education."

This can help students identify areas where they need to improve their understanding and adjust their learning strategies accordingly. Additionally, histograms can serve as diagnostic cues for students who answer questions incorrectly, helping them recognize their lack of preparation or problem-solving skills and become more metacognitively aware of their learning processes. Moreover, histograms can reduce feelings of hopelessness and fear of failure among anxious students, as they can see that they are not alone in struggling with course content. Finally, histograms can provide a brief explanation from the teacher if a student's answer is incorrect, helping to clarify any misunderstandings and improve learning outcomes. Overall, the use of histogram feedback in multiple-choice assessments can enhance student learning and self-assessment abilities."

This can help students develop a more critical and self-aware approach to their learning and improve their overall performance. Additionally, negatively tilted questions can create a safe space for students to discuss their mistakes and limitations without fear of judgment, which can foster a culture of openness and honesty.\n\nHowever, there are also potential challenges associated with using negatively tilted questions. One challenge is that students may feel defensive or embarrassed when faced with negative feedback, which can hinder their ability to learn from their mistakes. Additionally, if the facilitator's use of negatively tilted questions becomes too frequent or intense, it can create a negative and punitive environment that undermines the learning process. To mitigate these challenges, it is important for facilitators to use negatively tilted questions judiciously and in conjunction with positive and supportive feedback, creating a balance that encourages students to take risks and learn from their experiences."

      "content": "Incorporating technology into formative assessment can have several potential benefits for students with disabilities. Firstly, technology can provide opportunities for students with disabilities to access and participate in assessments that may have been previously inaccessible to them. For example, technology can be used to provide alternative formats for assessment materials, such as text-to-speech software or braille displays, which can help students with visual impairments or reading difficulties. Additionally, technology can provide a platform for students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in ways that may be more accessible to them, such as through the use of multimedia presentations or interactive simulations.\n\nMoreover, technology can help reduce missing data for students with disabilities, who often experience challenges in completing assessments due to cognitive or physical limitations. For instance, technology can be used to provide personalized assessment experiences tailored to the needs of individual students, such as language simplification, altering presentation modalities, or providing a targeted interface, time, or tools. This can help ensure that all students have equal opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, regardless of their abilities.\n\nFurthermore, technology can provide new opportunities for evaluating the impact of formative assessment on students' non-content-specific skills, such as self-regulation. For instance, moment-by-moment learning curves (MBMLCs) can be used to analyze the process data generated by technology-enhanced formative assessments, providing insights into students' learning behaviors and self-regulatory strategies. This can help educators identify areas where students may need additional support or scaffolding, and adjust their teaching methods accordingly.\n\nOverall, incorporating technology into formative assessment can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, providing them with equal opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, and helping educators identify areas where they may need additional support."

      "content": "Technology can be used to support the assessment of transversal skills, such as collaborative problem-solving and self-regulation, in formative assessment in several ways.\n\nFirstly, technology can be used to facilitate collaborative problem-solving activities, such as online group projects or peer review and feedback mechanisms, which can help assess students' ability to work effectively with others towards a common goal. These activities can be designed to require students to communicate, negotiate, and coordinate their efforts, demonstrating their ability to collaborate and solve complex problems.\n\nSecondly, technology can be used to provide real-time feedback to students on their progress and performance, helping them develop their self-regulation skills. For example, technology can be used to provide immediate feedback on students' answers, highlighting areas where they need improvement and suggesting resources to help them improve. Additionally, technology can be used to provide students with personalized learning paths and adaptive assessments that adjust their difficulty and content based on students' performance, helping them stay motivated and engaged in their learning.\n\nFurthermore, technology can be used to analyze process data generated by technology-enhanced formative assessments, providing insights into students' learning behaviors and self-regulatory strategies. For instance, moment-by-moment learning curves (MBMLCs) can be used to evaluate the impact of formative assessment on students' non-content-specific skills, such as self-regulation. This can help educators identify areas where students may need additional support or scaffolding, and adjust their teaching methods accordingly.\n\nOverall, technology can be a powerful tool to support the assessment of transversal skills, such as collaborative problem-solving and self-regulation, in formative assessment, providing real-time feedback, facilitating collaborative activities, and analyzing process data to inform instruction."

This can help teacher candidates to better understand the nuances of students' ideas and avoid oversimplifying them into correct or incorrect responses.\n\nSecondly, teacher candidates can engage in ongoing analysis of students' written work, looking for patterns and commonalities in their thinking. This can help them to identify areas where students may be struggling or have misconceptions, and to adjust their instruction accordingly. Additionally, teacher candidates can seek out opportunities for students to share their own interpretations and understandings of the material, such as through class discussions or presentations. By giving students a voice in the learning process, teacher candidates can gain a more nuanced understanding of their ideas and avoid imposing their own assumptions onto the students' learning.\n\nFinally, teacher candidates can reflect on their own questioning patterns and classroom interactions, considering how they might encourage students to take risks and explore their own ideas without fear of judgment. By doing so, teacher candidates can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that values diverse perspectives and fosters deeper understanding."

Self-control processes refer to the deployment of methods or strategies that help learners focus on the task, while self-observation processes involve monitoring the learning process and discerning patterns in one's behavior and the results of that behavior.\n\nFinally, the self-reflection phase includes self-evaluation of the success of a performance and attributing the outcome to a cause.

The external feedback source must have a clear understanding of the competencies required for mastering learning task requirements, and must be able to accurately represent these standards and competencies to the learner.\n\nSecondly, the quality of the external assessment is essential in generating meaningful external feedback. The assessment must be accurate and reliable, and must identify the learner's current level of competence in relation to the desired level of competence.\n\nThirdly, the quality of the external data processing is important in enabling meaningful comparisons between the assessed level of competence and the desired level of competence. The external feedback source must be able to process the information at hand adequately, and must be able to identify the discrepancies between the desired and current level of competence.\n\nLastly, the quality of the design and communication of the external feedback is critical in determining the effectiveness of the feedback. The external feedback source must be able to generate feedback messages that are tailored to the learner's level of competence, and that provide actionable information to help the learner improve. Additionally, the external feedback source must be able to communicate the feedback in a way that is mindful and attended by the learner.\n\nOverall, the effectiveness of external feedback in promoting learner improvement is influenced by a range of factors, including the quality of the external representation of standards and competencies, the quality of the external assessment, the quality of the external data processing, and the quality of the design and communication of the external feedback. By understanding and addressing these factors, educators can optimize the use of external feedback to support learner improvement."

Effective strategies for creating a positive learning environment include establishing clear classroom rules and procedures, using positive verbal and non-verbal communication, and fostering a culture of respect and inclusivity. Teachers can also use formative assessments to inform their instruction and adjust their teaching strategies based on the needs of their students. Additionally, incorporating technology and student-selected materials into the curriculum can help to increase student interest and motivation.\n\nTo establish a positive learning environment, teachers should begin lessons with thought-provoking activities or questions that reflect student interest or activate prior knowledge. This helps to capture student interest and engage them in the learning process. Teachers should also communicate with their students in a positive and respectful manner, using both verbal and non-verbal cues to reinforce desired behaviors and attitudes.\n\nAnother key strategy for creating a positive learning environment is to establish a consistent set of classroom rules and procedures, and to communicate these clearly to students. This helps to create a sense of order and structure in the classroom, which can promote a sense of safety and security for students. Additionally, teachers can use formative assessments to monitor student progress and adjust their instruction accordingly. By regularly checking in with students and providing feedback, teachers can help to build confidence and motivation among their students.\n\nFinally, incorporating technology and student-selected materials into the curriculum can help to increase student interest and motivation. When students have a say in what they learn and how they learn it, they are more likely to be engaged in the learning process. This can also help to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among students, which can lead to increased academic achievement.\n\nOverall, creating a positive learning environment is essential for promoting student engagement and academic achievement. By using effective strategies such as establishing clear classroom rules and procedures, using positive communication, incorporating technology and student-selected materials, and regularly monitoring student progress, teachers can create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that benefits all students."

      "content": "Involving students as partners in the development of feedback practices can contribute to an enhanced sense of belonging and affiliation, which can lead to calmer emotions and a greater sense of motivation. This can be achieved by incorporating principles of respect, reciprocity, and shared responsibility into the feedback process. Additionally, involving students in the development of feedback practices can promote reciprocity and other prosocial behaviors through feelings of gratitude and appreciation.\n\nTo involve students as partners in the development of feedback practices, instructors can start by engaging them in discussions about the purpose and goals of feedback, and seeking their input on how they would like to receive feedback. Instructors can also consider using student-led feedback sessions, where students provide feedback to one another, or peer review activities where students evaluate and provide feedback on each other's work.\n\nThe potential benefits of involving students as partners in the development of feedback practices include increased student motivation and engagement, as well as improved feedback quality and relevance. When students are involved in the feedback process, they are more likely to take ownership of their learning and feel invested in the feedback they receive. This can lead to greater accountability and a stronger sense of responsibility among students. Additionally, involving students in the development of feedback practices can help to create a more collaborative and supportive learning environment, where students are encouraged to work together to improve their learning outcomes."

Additionally, she used formative assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of her instruction and identify areas where students may need additional support or scaffolding. For example, after participating in several learning activities that focused on the relationship between surface area and rate of diffusion, Phoebe observed that some students were struggling to apply the principle to a new context. In response, she adjusted her instruction to include more explicit teaching on the relationship between surface area and function, and provided additional scaffolding to help students apply the principle in a new context. By using formative assessment to inform her instruction, Phoebe was able to adapt her teaching strategies to meet the needs of her students and promote deep learning."

Formative assessment is designed to monitor student progress and provide feedback during the learning process, with the goal of improving student performance and guiding further instruction. Summative assessment, on the other hand, evaluates student learning at the end of a lesson, unit, or course, and provides a final judgment of student achievement.\n\nHowever, the author argues that assessment cannot be understood in isolation from the wider context within which it takes place. Teachers and schools are influenced by cultural traditions, political and public expectations, and the norms of their institutional environment, which can impact the way assessment is implemented. Therefore, it is important to consider the context in which assessment is taking place when designing and implementing assessment strategies.\n\nThe author suggests that assessment should not only focus on producing valid inferences about student learning, but also take into account the feasibility of change within the existing systems and structures. This requires a careful consideration of the tools available, the division of labor, and the community in which the assessment is taking place. By considering these factors, educators can develop assessment practices that are effective, practical, and aligned with the goals of education.\n\nIn conclusion, formative and summative assessment are two distinct types of assessment that serve different purposes in pedagogy. However, the effectiveness of assessment is highly dependent on the context in which it takes place. Therefore, educators must carefully consider the wider context when designing and implementing assessment strategies to ensure that they are both valid and feasible."

One approach to evaluating concept maps is to use a graph theoretical evaluation, which can provide limited information about the quality of the content of the individual components. Another approach is to use a qualitative approach, which can provide more useful information for formative assessment but is time-consuming. To make concept maps a quick and easy formative assessment method, machine learning techniques can be used. The benefits of using concept maps for formative assessment include tracing misunderstandings about certain connections, evaluating students' prior knowledge, and meaningfully adapting further learning and teaching."

Criteria-referenced assessment: Assessment tasks should be designed to align with specific standards and outcomes, and the criteria for evaluation should be clearly defined and communicated to students.\n3. Multiple assessment methods: A range of assessment methods should be used to evaluate different learning outcomes and to avoid overreliance on any one method.\n4. Balance of assessment approaches: The balance of assessment methods should reflect the range of learning outcomes being pursued, and no single method should dominate the assessment strategy.\n5. Threshold for achievement: All students must meet the threshold for achievement of each learning outcome in order to complete the unit or be awarded the qualification.\n6. No compensation for overachievement: Students cannot be rewarded for exceeding the minimum requirements of a learning outcome, as the focus is on meeting the standards and outcomes rather than excelling beyond them.\n7. Emphasis on student self-assessment: The discourse of teachers and assessors should focus on the characteristics of student work in the language of outcomes and standards, rather than marks or competition.

By engaging in these activities, students can gain a clearer understanding of what constitutes good work and how to improve their own work. Additionally, the authors note that exemplification (i.e., showing examples of good work) can be an effective way to help students understand what is expected of them. Overall, the authors suggest that teachers should aim to help students develop a deep understanding of the subject matter, rather than simply focusing on rote memorization of facts and procedures."

This phase is crucial for setting goals, developing a plan, and building confidence in one's ability to succeed.\n\nDuring the performance phase, students execute their learning plans and use self-control processes such as focusing on the task at hand and monitoring their progress. They also use self-observation processes to evaluate their progress and make adjustments as needed.\n\nFinally, in the self-reflection phase, students evaluate the success of their performance and attribute the outcome to a cause. This phase is critical for self-evaluation, self-adjustment, and the development of new goals and plans for future learning. These three phases are interconnected and form a cyclical process, with self-reflection from prior efforts influencing subsequent forethought processes."

      "content": "To promote self-regulation and effective use of feedback among law students, several strategies can be employed. Firstly, incorporating self-management skills into the first year law curriculum can help students develop independent learning and reflective/self-assessment capabilities. This can include using feedback effectively, particularly when it is negative. Additionally, teaching students to reframe negative feedback in a positive way through cognitive restructuring or cognitive reappraisal techniques can help manage and regulate emotions in feedback contexts.\n\nAnother strategy is to promote peer and self-assessment, which can increase student responsibility for learning and develop their ability to make judgments about their own and others' work. This can also help address staff workload issues. Furthermore, giving and receiving feedback provides opportunities for students to develop different types of skills, such as critical thinking and communication, and can potentially reduce anxiety through supportive learning groups.\n\nHowever, implementing these strategies on a large scale can be challenging due to workload implications for lecturers. Therefore, institutional-level resourcing to support professional development activities targeted at changing academic attitudes and behaviors is necessary. Moreover, obtaining students' buy-in is crucial, as they must act on feedback for it to be effective. Some students may be reluctant to adopt practices such as self-evaluation, which require autonomous learning. Similarly, teachers may be reluctant to engage in such practices out of concern for negative impacts on their teaching evaluations and the consequent loss of time to cover disciplinary content."

      "content": "Some of the challenges faced by teachers in implementing formative assessment practices in different countries include differences in traditional assessment practices, a lack of clarity around the formative or summative status of assessments, and the dominance of high-stakes testing regimes. Additionally, there may be cultural and linguistic barriers that affect the way students respond to assessments, and the pressure to achieve high grades can create stress and impact student well-being.\n\nTo address these challenges, teachers could consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers should be aware of the cultural backgrounds of their students and adapt their teaching methods accordingly. This can involve using authentic materials and examples that reflect the students' cultures, and incorporating diverse perspectives into the curriculum.\n2. Clear communication: Teachers should clearly communicate the formative or summative status of assessments to students, and provide explicit criteria for success. This can help students understand the purpose of the assessment and how it contributes to their learning.\n3. Flexible assessment designs: Teachers should consider using a variety of assessment formats and tasks that allow students to demonstrate their learning in different ways. This can help to reduce the pressure to achieve high grades and encourage more experimental and open learning behaviors.\n4. Collaboration with students: Teachers should work with students to co-create learning goals and assessment criteria, and involve them in the assessment process as much as possible. This can help to increase student engagement and agency, and promote a growth mindset.\n5. Professional development: Teachers should engage in ongoing professional development to learn about effective formative assessment practices and how to implement them in their classrooms. This can help to build their capacity to design and implement assessments that support student learning.\n\nBy addressing these challenges and incorporating effective formative assessment practices, teachers can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that promotes student engagement, motivation, and achievement."

One major challenge was the cultural norms and expectations of her students, who were accustomed to a culture of right and wrong, \"making the grade,\" and competition among students rather than learning for its intrinsic value. This made it difficult for Phoebe to help her students break free from these traditional norms and strive for understanding rather than basing their success on their ability to make a good grade. Another challenge was the demanding pace she felt compelled to keep, which limited her ability to realize the full potential of formative assessment practices. To address these challenges, Phoebe continually struggled to help her students understand the importance of learning for its intrinsic value, and she used various strategies such as peer interaction and collaborative learning to encourage deeper understanding and transfer of knowledge. Additionally, she sought support from her administration and science department colleagues to create a more supportive and cooperative learning environment."

The author argues that formative assessment, as a central aspect of educational research, must also acknowledge these factors and recognize the potential for change and adaptation in response to new information and circumstances.\n\nIn particular, the author emphasizes the significance of collective implicit knowledge and the importance of continuous staffing stability in the development and implementation of formative assessment practices. This suggests that formative assessment should be seen as an ongoing process of reflection, adaptation, and improvement, rather than a fixed set of procedures or tools. Additionally, the author highlights the need for educators and policymakers to recognize the value of formative assessment as a means of improving teaching and learning, rather than simply expecting different outcomes from the same traditional approaches."

Additionally, they expected that students who perceived their teachers as using classroom discussions would report higher levels of controlled motivation. The researchers also tested the mediating effect of need satisfaction and frustration on the relationship between perceptions of formative assessment strategies and motivation.\n\nIn particular, the researchers found that students' perceptions of clarifying criteria, teacher feedback, and self and peer assessment were significantly associated with autonomous motivation, while only classroom discussions were significantly associated with controlled motivation. The study also found significant indirect effects of the perceptions of formative assessment strategies on motivation through need satisfaction and frustration. The results suggest that teachers can promote students' motivation by using formative assessment strategies that are perceived as supportive and foster a sense of autonomy and self-regulation among students."

The author suggests that reviewing research is not a derivative form of scholarship, and that their approach to exploring policy implications in a booklet entitled \"Inside the Black Box\" was different from traditional standards of scholarship, being more focused on reasonableness than academic rationality. The author acknowledges that their opinions and prejudices are present in the booklet, but claims that they are supported by evidence and consistent with 50 years of experience in the field. The author suggests that the success of \"Inside the Black Box\" has been due to its rhetorical force, which blurs the line between fact and value.

This type of assessment focuses on excellent experiences, prioritizes cultural strengths, and identifies topics capable of making changes in the organization.\n\nType 3: This type combines AI steps at every stage of education, such as the study of Andrus (2010) which repeatedly applies all four AI phases through setting the tone, building momentum, and tolerating change.\n\nIn comparison to traditional assessment methods, appreciative inquiry is focused on the positive aspects of student learning, rather than solely focusing on problems and deficits. Traditional assessment methods often rely on standardized tests and evaluations, while appreciative inquiry emphasizes the importance of social and organizational changes to improve learning outcomes. Additionally, appreciative inquiry involves students in the assessment process and encourages them to take an active role in their own learning, whereas traditional assessment methods tend to be more teacher-centered."

One challenge is the socio-cultural context of teaching, learning, and assessment, which can thwart good intentions and apparent design. Another challenge is the risk of common assessment practices sending mixed messages to students, leading to unintended consequences for student learning. To address these challenges, it is important to consider the potential impact of assessment tasks on student motivation and engagement, as well as the potential for assessment to reinforce or undermine desired learning outcomes. Additionally, assessment tasks should be carefully designed to avoid creating situations in which students feel under surveillance and are less likely to take risks. Finally, the use of technology can help to facilitate sustainable assessment by enabling students to receive timely and targeted feedback and supporting the integration of assessment with teaching and learning."

Identifying oneself as an active learner: Students must take responsibility for their own learning and see themselves as active participants in the learning process.\n2. Identifying one's own level of knowledge and the gaps in this: Students must be able to accurately assess their own understanding of the material and identify areas where they need further learning.\n3. Practicing testing and judging: Students must engage in regular testing and evaluation of their own learning to develop their critical thinking and judgment skills.\n4. Developing these skills over time: These skills must be developed gradually over the course of the student's academic career, with increasing complexity and challenge.\n5. Embodying reflexivity and commitment: Students must be willing to reflect on their own learning and be committed to continuous improvement and growth.\n\nThese elements are designed to help students become \"judges of their own learning,\" capable of making informed decisions about their own educational progress and future development. By focusing on the development of these skills, educators can help students become more autonomous and self-directed learners, better equipped to succeed in their academic and professional pursuits."

This phase involves setting goals and developing strategies to achieve them.\n\nDuring the performance phase, students execute their learning plans and use self-control processes like focusing on the task at hand and monitoring their progress. They also engage in self-observation processes, such as evaluating their own learning and adjusting their strategies as needed.\n\nFinally, in the self-reflection phase, students evaluate the success of their performance and attribute the outcome to a cause. This phase is critical because it informs the next cycle of forethought processes, allowing students to refine their strategies and improve their learning outcomes.\n\nThroughout these three phases, students engage in a variety of metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral processes that help them regulate their learning and achieve their academic goals."

Graduate attribute statements could also be better integrated into assessment policies, intentionally aligning the development of student emotional capabilities such as interpersonal skills and resilience with the development of self-management skills in relation to feedback. This approach would not only enhance awareness among staff of emotions in learning but also contribute to a more holistic understanding of student learning outcomes. Moreover, the integration of co-curricular and curricular strategies into an intentionally designed and broadly conceptualized curriculum, as proposed by Kift et al.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The three dimensions of formative assessment are the three agents involved in the assessment process (teacher, peer, and learner), the time frame of the adjustment cycle, and the frequency of adjustments made based on elicited information about student learning. These dimensions work together to support student engagement and learning in several ways.\n\nFirstly, the inclusion of all three agents in the assessment process allows for a collaborative approach to learning, where students can help each other and the teacher in the assessment process. This fosters a sense of community and shared responsibility for learning, which can increase student engagement and motivation. Additionally, the teacher can support students' motivation and skills to take an active part in the assessment process, further promoting engagement and learning.\n\nSecondly, the time frame of the adjustment cycle is crucial in supporting student learning. The length of the adjustment cycle determines how quickly feedback is received and acted upon, and how often teaching and learning are adjusted based on elicited information. A short adjustment cycle, such as a few seconds or minutes, can allow for immediate feedback and adjustments, which can be particularly effective in promoting student learning. On the other hand, a longer adjustment cycle, such as days or months, can provide more time for reflection and adjustments, allowing for more profound changes to instruction and learning.\n\nLastly, the frequency of adjustments made based on elicited information about student learning is also important. Adjustments made frequently, such as every lesson or instructional unit, can provide students with timely feedback and support, helping them stay on track and address any misconceptions or challenges they may be facing. Less frequent adjustments, such as at the end of a term, may provide a more comprehensive view of student learning, but may not be as responsive to immediate needs.\n\nOverall, the three dimensions of formative assessment work together to create a dynamic and responsive learning environment, where students are actively engaged in their own learning and receive timely feedback and support. By understanding and incorporating these dimensions into their teaching practices, educators can promote deeper learning and better outcomes for their students."

For instance, writing an academic essay necessitates more sophisticated abilities than reacting to factual inquiries. To effectively govern the system, it is crucial to delineate the controlled process meticulously and explicitly, as an exact depiction of competencies provides the foundation for distinguishing the pertinent control variables and their corresponding benchmarks, evaluating the current state of these control variables, and creating control activities. Without an exact portrayal of competencies, the understudy and outside input sources cannot know which abilities are expected to dominate undertaking prerequisites, and along these lines cannot dependably evaluate them or create input or activities for enhancing these abilities.\n\nTherefore, the essential components that affect the process of obtaining competencies required for mastering learning tasks in an educational setting are the complexity of the task, the clarity of the task requirements, and the availability of external feedback. These factors influence the degree of difficulty in identifying and describing precisely the competencies necessary for meeting the task requirements, and ultimately impact the effectiveness of the learning process."

Next, they conducted a systematic computerized search of electronic databases, including Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsychInfo, Proquest Research Library, Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Dissertations Abstracts International. They used keywords such as \"formative evaluation,\" \"formative assessment,\" \"formative test,\" and \"assessment for learning\" to retrieve relevant articles. Additionally, they identified relevant articles presented at conferences and retrieved them for further analysis. To ensure the quality of the studies, the researchers analyzed each study's quality and removed those with severe design flaws that would systematically bias results. Specifically, they excluded studies that were descriptive in nature or did not allow for the calculation of the desired effect size statistic. The final sample consisted of 13 studies with 42 independent effect sizes."

The treatment type also had a significant effect (p < .0001), although the percentage of variance explained was small. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of effect sizes and potential moderator variables analyzed.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, the meta-analysis used a fixed effects approach to calculate the weighted mean effect size, and a random effects approach to account for the variation in effect sizes across studies. The Q statistic was used to assess the significance of the moderating variables, and the I2 statistic was used to measure the proportion of variation in effect sizes that could not be explained by sampling variability.

Firstly, technology can provide opportunities for students with disabilities to access and participate in assessments that may have been previously inaccessible to them. For example, technology can be used to provide alternative formats for assessment materials, such as text-to-speech software or braille displays, which can help students with visual impairments or reading difficulties. Additionally, technology can provide a platform for students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in ways that may be more accessible to them, such as through the use of multimedia presentations or interactive simulations.\n\nMoreover, technology can help reduce missing data for students with disabilities, who often experience challenges in completing assessments due to cognitive or physical limitations. For instance, technology can be used to provide personalized assessment experiences tailored to the needs of individual students, such as language simplification, altering presentation modalities, or providing a targeted interface, time, or tools. This can help ensure that all students have equal opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, regardless of their abilities.\n\nFurthermore, technology can provide new opportunities for evaluating the impact of formative assessment on students' non-content-specific skills, such as self-regulation. For instance, moment-by-moment learning curves (MBMLCs) can be used to analyze the process data generated by technology-enhanced formative assessments, providing insights into students' learning behaviors and self-regulatory strategies. This can help educators identify areas where students may need additional support or scaffolding, and adjust their teaching methods accordingly.\n\nOverall, incorporating technology into formative assessment can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, providing them with equal opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, and helping educators identify areas where they may need additional support."

Secondly, the teacher delays responding to the student's initial answer, allowing them time to think and reflect on their presentation. This delay creates a \"filled pause\" that encourages the student to elaborate on their response. Additionally, the teacher's use of an open-ended question (\"It went better than expected, right?\") and their focus on the student's perspective (\"How do you think it went?\") further encourage the student to engage in self-assessment. Finally, the teacher provides an account on behalf of the student, which legitimizes the student's self-assessment and encourages them to continue evaluating their own performance.

However, the study acknowledges that self-report measures have limitations, such as the possibility that students may respond in a way that \"makes them look good\" or struggle to give accurate accounts of their behavior. Additionally, the study notes that questionnaire items about SRL behavior typically ask students to report on their use of specific SRL skills, but do not distinguish between whether these skills are used together in a cyclical process or continuously on their own initiative. The study suggests that complementing self-report measures with other measurements of SRL, such as classroom observations, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of students' SRL practice."

The underlying principles include the provision of feedback, the assessment of hard-to-measure constructs, and the inclusion of new item types capable of providing more nuanced information about learning. Best practices include considering four types of learning for building critical skills in STEM, such as problem and research-based learning, enquiry-based learning, collaborative learning, and mobile learning. Additionally, the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, the Formative Assessment in Science and Mathematics Education (FaSMEd) model, and the digital literacy model can be used to frame digital formative assessment.\n\nThe potential benefits of using technology in formative assessment include automation of the feedback process, access for students with disabilities, and greater opportunities for student collaboration. However, there are also challenges such as the need for adequate support and training for teachers in the implementation of technology-enhanced formative assessment systems, and the importance of ensuring that the use of technology does not compromise the validity of the assessment process.\n\nIn order to implement digital formative assessment effectively in STEM education, it is important to consider the specific needs and goals of the curriculum and the learners, and to carefully select and use appropriate technologies that align with these goals. Additionally, ongoing professional development for teachers and students is essential to ensure that they have the necessary technological competencies and literacies to effectively integrate technology into the assessment process."

When the student does not respond immediately, the teacher reformulates the question by repeating the key phrase \"What do you think yourself?\" (line 04) to prompt the student to provide an answer.\n\nThe teacher also uses a hesitation marker \"e:\" (line 07) to indicate that the student's response is uncertain or tentative, which encourages the student to provide a more nuanced self-assessment. Additionally, the teacher uses a mitigating device \"I believe\" (line 07) to soften the student's response and make it less absolute.\n\nFurthermore, the teacher provides an account (lines 10-11) that frames the student's presentation in a certain context, namely, being new in the class and giving an oral presentation for the first time. This implicit disclaimer provides reasons for positively assessing the student's presentation, and the teacher's final rising intonation (line 10) invites the student to confirm and expand on this feature.

For example, research has shown that teacher feedback motivates girls in particular to learn, as they have a positive attitude towards teacher feedback and are aware of its quality, which improves their perceptions of competence and metacognitive skills. However, there may be differences between groups of students in terms of which aspects of the material they focus on based on the value they attach to the final grade on a test, and their motivation determines which parts of the course material they prioritize. Additionally, teacher feedback can help students who are too inhibited to ask for help or do not realize they need it, as they receive valuable information from their teacher without having to ask for it."

Instead, they propose a more nuanced understanding of assessment as a continuum of activities that are designed to support learning and improve student performance.\n\nAccording to Black and Wiliam, formative assessment is not limited to the beginning of the learning process, and summative assessment is not solely focused on evaluating student performance at the end of a lesson or unit. Rather, assessment is a continuous process that is integrated into the learning experience and is used to inform instruction and improve student learning.

This allows the teacher to evaluate the extent of student understanding and serves as the basis for class discussion.\n4. Differentiated assessments: Teachers recognize the need for differentiation in the assessment tasks, as they have pointed out that the material targeted the average pupil, leaving high achievers feeling bored and less academically advanced children struggling to finish their work in time.\n5. Whole class quizzes: Teachers use whole class quizzes to check immediately students' understanding of key points or concepts. This approach allows the teacher to identify areas where the class may need additional support or review."

Firstly, research has shown that students tend to ignore comments when marks are also given, suggesting that the presence of grades can actually hinder the effectiveness of feedback. By removing grades, students may be more likely to engage with the feedback and use it to improve their work. Additionally, providing feedback without grades can help to focus parents' attention on the learning issues rather than the grade itself, which can be more productive for student learning. Finally, comments can be more meaningful and actionable when they are not accompanied by a grade, as they can provide specific guidance on how to improve without the distraction of a numerical score."

They look at the learning objectives, assessment, and lesson activities collectively to ensure coherence and alignment. Additionally, they leave room for adjusting and improving teaching and learning based on the data collected from formative assessments.\n\nTo begin with, experienced teachers use a coherent foundation of existing lessons that are aligned with desired learning objectives, as stated by Tracy. These lessons serve as a starting point for designing formative assessment plans that are aligned with the learning objectives and criteria for success. Moreover, Patricia emphasizes that aligning formative assessment with existing lessons and lesson activities is an active process that involves determining whether lesson planning needs to be adjusted based on the choices made in designing formative assessment. This ensures that the formative assessment plan is not only aligned with the learning objectives but also enhances learning.\n\nDuring the design process, the teachers continuously check for alignment among the learning objectives, assessment, and lesson activities. Stuart highlights the importance of checking for coherency and alignment after the design process during and after the execution of the formative assessment plan. This ensures that the formative assessment plan is effective in achieving the desired learning objectives and makes any necessary adjustments to improve teaching and learning.\n\nIn summary, experienced teachers design formative assessment plans that are aligned with learning objectives, lesson activities, and other assessments by using a coherent foundation of existing lessons, continuously checking for alignment during the design process, and leaving room for adjusting and improving teaching and learning based on the data collected from formative assessments."

This can help to reduce the burden of summative assessment at the end of the semester while still promoting deep learning and engagement among students.\n\nAnother effective strategy is to incorporate well-designed formative tasks, such as blogging, into the course. These tasks should be public-facing, link to the summative task in a challenging and enriching way, build in elements of collaboration and accountability, involve challenging research, theory, or project design, and link to the discipline and have a genuine purpose. For example, students could be asked to blog fortnightly in class on academic readings, with their peers commenting on their posts. This approach can promote engagement with academic texts, reflection, distribution of effort, and deep learning.\n\nFinally, using projects as a formative assessment method can also be an effective strategy for reducing the load of summative assessment. These projects should be large, challenging, collaborative (or individual), and involve designing publicly available artefacts, such as films or posters, to address an issue or problem in the discipline. By incorporating these strategies, instructors can promote deep learning and engagement among students while reducing the load of summative assessment."

Assessment of the current state of the control variables: This component involves evaluating the learner's current level of performance on the identified control variables. Both internal (self-assessment) and external (assessment by a teacher or other external source) assessments are important.\n3. Use of feedback information to generate control actions: Once the current state of the control variables has been assessed, the next step is to use this information to adjust the learning process. This may involve revisiting previous learning material, seeking additional resources, or receiving guidance from a teacher or mentor. The goal is to close the feedback loop by using the information gained from assessment to improve learning outcomes.\n\nIn the ITF-model, these three components work together to create a cycle of continuous improvement, where learners receive regular feedback on their progress, adjust their learning accordingly, and continue to improve over time."

The treatment type also had a significant effect (p < .0001), although the percentage of variance explained was small. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of effect sizes and potential moderator variables analyzed.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, the meta-analysis used a fixed effects approach to calculate the weighted mean effect size, and a random effects approach to account for the variation in effect sizes across studies. The Q statistic was used to assess the significance of the moderating variables, and the I2 statistic was used to measure the proportion of variation in effect sizes that could not be explained by sampling variability. The results showed that the majority of the nonchance variation in the results was due to the content area of the studies, followed by the treatment type."

Firstly, the student's delay in responding and provision of a downgraded positive assessment contributes to the maintenance of a positive interpersonal tone in the supervisory interaction. By avoiding direct evaluation and focusing on self-assessment, the student is able to maintain a sense of control over the interaction and avoid potential conflict. Secondly, the student's provision of an account of their preparation time serves to legitimize their self-assessment and potentially influence the teacher's evaluation.

The author suggests that while much of the scholarly literature on pedagogy has focused on the social, cultural, and political context of schooling, there is a need to better understand how assessment practices intersect with pedagogy. The author contends that assessment is not just a secondary influence on classroom practice, but rather an integral part of teaching and learning.\n\nThe author highlights the importance of considering the theoretical framework of pedagogy when developing formative assessment practices. The author notes that most writers on pedagogy have focused on the social and cultural context of schooling, leaving a gap in the understanding of how assessment practices fit into pedagogy. The author argues that filling this gap is essential for developing a comprehensive theory of formative assessment.\n\nFurthermore, the author suggests that the emphasis on holding schools and teachers accountable for student performance on standardized tests in countries such as Australia, England, and the USA has made assessment an even more critical component of classroom practice. Therefore, the author concludes that understanding the relationship between formative assessment and pedagogy is crucial for effective teaching and learning."

Real-time feedback is provided to students while they are engaging in the learning activity and can be in the form of embedded formative quizzes or real-time suggestions for better performance. Immediate feedback is provided to students after they have completed the learning activity and can be in the form of a report or a dashboard. Delayed feedback is provided to students after a significant amount of time has passed since the learning activity and can be in the form of a final grade or a comprehensive report.\n\nThe advantages of real-time feedback include the ability to adjust learning strategies during the learning process, increased student engagement, and improved learning outcomes. The disadvantages of real-time feedback include the potential for distraction, the lack of depth in the feedback provided, and the possibility of overwhelming students with too much information.\n\nImmediate feedback provides students with valuable insights into their performance and can help them identify areas for improvement. However, immediate feedback can also be time-consuming and resource-intensive to provide, and may not always be accurate or constructive.\n\nDelayed feedback provides students with a comprehensive evaluation of their performance and can help them understand the bigger picture. However, delayed feedback may not be useful for students who need immediate guidance and support during the learning process."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Technology-enhanced formative assessment systems in online learning environments face several challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. One major challenge is the lack of observable signs of understanding in computer-aided environments, making it difficult for instructors to assess student learning accurately. Additionally, these systems often rely on the collection and processing of large amounts of data, which can be time-consuming and may require specialized expertise to analyze effectively.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have proposed the use of machine learning algorithms to automatically extract relevant information from large datasets and provide real-time feedback to both instructors and students. For instance, Papamitsiou and Economides (2014) developed a system that uses natural language processing techniques to analyze student responses and provide personalized feedback. Similarly, other researchers have explored the use of automated scoring engines to quickly and accurately assess student performance (e.g., Bennett & Fan, 2017).\n\nAnother approach to addressing the challenges of technology-enhanced formative assessment is to incorporate human evaluators into the system. For example, Sadler (1998) suggested that human evaluators can provide more nuanced and accurate assessments of student learning by observing student behavior and performance over time. This approach can help to supplement the limitations of automated systems and provide more comprehensive feedback to students.\n\nFinally, to ensure the effectiveness of technology-enhanced formative assessment systems, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications of these systems and their potential impact on student learning. Researchers have found that students who receive frequent and timely feedback tend to perform better academically and develop a stronger sense of self-efficacy (e.g., Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Therefore, educators should carefully select and implement technology-enhanced formative assessment systems that align with their teaching goals and objectives, and provide ongoing support and training to ensure that these systems are used effectively."

      "content": "Students often struggle to accurately monitor their own learning due to the limitations of their metacognitive skills, such as the tendency to rely on non-diagnostic cues like recognition of previous questions rather than on diagnostic cues that accurately reflect their mental representation of the learning material. Additionally, students may have difficulty distinguishing between task information, personal information, and contextual information that is relevant for monitoring their learning.\n\nFormative assessments can help address these challenges by providing students with opportunities to practice and receive feedback on their learning, thereby increasing their awareness of their strengths and weaknesses. Formative assessments can also help students develop a better understanding of what it means to be proficient in a particular skill or subject area, which can improve their ability to accurately monitor their own learning. Furthermore, well-aligned formative assessments can provide diagnostic information that helps students identify areas where they need to focus their efforts in order to improve their learning outcomes.\n\nTo illustrate, if a student is struggling to correctly solve a problem, a formative assessment can provide immediate feedback on the specific aspects of the problem that the student needs to work on in order to improve. By receiving this type of targeted feedback, the student can adjust their learning strategies and better monitor their progress over time. Similarly, if a student is relying too heavily on non-diagnostic cues to monitor their learning, a well-designed formative assessment can help the student develop a more accurate understanding of their learning progress by providing feedback on the quality of their learning processes and strategies."

      "content": "Students categorized as emotionally changeable are heavily influenced by their emotions when receiving feedback on their academic performance. They tend to be highly invested in their studies and have fragile confidence, which makes them sensitive to negative feedback. When receiving a poor grade, they may experience strong emotions such as anger, disappointment, and tears. These emotions can make it difficult for them to engage with the feedback and attribute the outcome to the lecturer's perceived unfairness. However, after the emotional reaction has passed, they tend to increase their motivation and try to improve their grade outcome in the next assessment.\n\nTo support students categorized as emotionally changeable, instructors can use several strategies. Firstly, providing written feedback, particularly in the form of written comments, can be helpful for these students as they find it more useful in improving their performance in the next assessment. Additionally, group-based feedback can be beneficial as it allows students to work together to review and apply the feedback. Instructors can also consider providing positive feedback to help build the students' confidence and motivation. It is essential to ensure that the feedback is constructive and specific, as vague or overly critical feedback can exacerbate the students' emotional responses. By using these strategies, instructors can help students categorized as emotionally changeable to engage with feedback, improve their learning outcomes, and maintain their motivation and self-confidence."

Firstly, he began using mini-whiteboards and exit passes to elicit evidence of students' learning. Mini-whiteboards allow all students to respond to the teacher's questions simultaneously, providing the teacher with immediate information about every student's learning. Exit passes allow students to reflect on their learning at the end of a lesson and provide the teacher with valuable information about their understanding.\n\nSecondly, Fredric used a conscious selection of tasks based on a diagnosis of the students' learning needs. He selected tasks that were tailored to the needs of individual students, rather than working with all tasks in the textbook. This allowed him to adjust the instructional activities to better meet the students' needs. Additionally, he used written feedback to communicate with his students, providing two positive aspects of their work and one specific suggestion for improvement, known as \"two stars and a wish.\"\n\nOverall, Fredric's strategies aimed to provide better service to each individual student by gathering information about their learning needs and adjusting his teaching accordingly. By using a variety of formative assessment techniques, he was able to identify areas where students needed additional support and provide targeted feedback to help them improve their learning outcomes."

Furthermore, teacher educators can play a crucial role in encouraging teacher candidates to use students' ideas in a more nuanced way by providing professional development opportunities that focus on the developmental affordances of learning progressions and the importance of considering students' ideas in formative assessment practices."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The author argues that educational research is not a steady accumulation of knowledge towards an objective truth about teaching and learning, but rather a trajectory buffeted by various factors. The author suggests that educational research is characterized by a \"mangle of practice\" where scientific knowledge is constantly being challenged and modified by its interaction with the objective physical world. The author emphasizes that formative assessment is a crucial aspect of educational research, as it allows for the continuous refinement of theories and practices based on their effectiveness in real-world settings.\n\nThe author highlights the importance of recognizing the contingent and fragile nature of educational research, and the need to adapt to changing circumstances and priorities. The author suggests that supporting educational research, including formative assessment, is essential for improving teaching and learning, but that simply continuing with existing approaches and expecting different outcomes is \"crazy.\"\n\nIn summary, the author's argument is that formative assessment is a critical component of educational research, but that research itself is inherently messy, contingent, and subject to ongoing revision based on new evidence and changing contexts. By acknowledging and embracing these characteristics, educators and policymakers can work towards more effective and responsive teaching and learning practices."

Firstly, richer measurement and intervention methods should be introduced to address the lack of cultivation of learners' objective knowledge in current instruction based on the 4C/ID model. This can involve using video clips of classroom sessions to facilitate reflective questioning, designing effective discussions, and fostering teacher-student interactions to explore conceptual understanding of objective knowledge. Additionally, emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and computer simulation software can be employed to enhance students' comprehension of abstract foundational knowledge.\n\nMoreover, during the design process of formative assessment systems, researchers must comprehensively consider the cultivation of students' cognitive schema construction, cognitive load, learning attitude, and professional emotion associated with complex problem-solving situations to achieve a more comprehensive evaluation and improvement of students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes in the learning process. Furthermore, the study highlights the significance of considering other aspects of assessment for learning, such as teachers' metacognitive abilities and knowledge base, effective classroom management and diverse teaching methods, as well as interactions and collaboration between teachers and students. By incorporating these strategies, educators can create a more comprehensive and effective formative assessment system that supports the acquisition of complex skills in the classroom."

Lack of understanding of evaluation indicators: Learners' understanding of evaluation indicators is crucial in determining whether formative evaluation can effectively help them identify and overcome their weaknesses. However, existing instructional and assessing frameworks often fail to provide clear and consistent guidelines for both teachers and learners.\n2. Inconsistency between teaching processes and assessment: The teaching process and assessment should be consistent to ensure that students can successfully solve learning tasks. However, existing studies have shown that there is often a mismatch between the teaching process and the assessment, which can hinder the effectiveness of formative assessment.\n3. Limited feedback channels for teachers: Existing studies rarely discuss how to provide teachers with feedback channels concerning formative assessment results to improve the effectiveness of assessment. This lack of feedback can limit the ability of teachers to adjust their instruction and support student learning.\n4. Difficulty in evaluating complex skill learning: Formative assessment can be particularly challenging when it comes to evaluating complex skill learning, as it requires a deep understanding of the learning process and the ability to observe and evaluate student performance in real time.\n5. Limited research on the effectiveness of formative assessment: Although there is a growing body of research on formative assessment, there is limited research on its effectiveness in improving student learning outcomes. This lack of evidence makes it difficult for teachers to know whether the formative assessment strategies they are using are effective or not.\n\nOverall, these challenges highlight the need for further research and support for teachers in implementing formative assessment in real classroom settings."

Key features of sustainable assessment include focusing on the development of informed judgment, self-assessment, and scaffolding students to build their capacity for judging their own work. To support student learning and development, assessment tasks can be designed to break down complex tasks into smaller activities over time, engage students in identifying criteria for success ahead of their substantive involvement in the task, and emphasize building capacity for judging one's own work.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals, assessment tasks should be designed to maximize the possibility of alignment with learning outcomes, focus student attention on disciplinary outcomes, and scaffold students to develop their judgments. For example, assessment tasks could be designed to require students to identify and apply relevant criteria for success, or to engage in self-assessment and peer review to help them develop their critical thinking skills. Additionally, assessment tasks could be designed to encourage students to reflect on their own learning and identify areas for improvement, further supporting their development as self-regulated learners. Overall, sustainable assessment in higher education requires a deliberate focus on developing students' ability to make informed judgments about their own work, and assessment tasks should be designed to support this goal."

Firstly, there needs to be a conceptual shift in how feedback is viewed, as emphasized by Boud and Molloy (2013b). This requires a move away from focusing solely on the capacities of the teacher and towards a more robust view of feedback that prioritizes the needs of learning. Additionally, Cramp et al. (2012) highlight the need to address the broader impact of assessment on emotions in higher education, as current practices can cause anxiety among students. To overcome these challenges, institutions must provide structural opportunities for students and faculty to experience the benefits of alternative pedagogies, such as smaller class sizes and adequate time for communication. However, contextual factors like overloading of teaching staff and increasing class sizes may limit the feasibility of such changes. Therefore, partnerships between academics, students, and professional staff could be fostered at an institutional level to achieve sustainable changes in AFL."

They choose to focus on these specifically because they want to explore the relationship between the emphasis of the formative assessment intervention and student learning. By including both comprehensive formative assessment practices and specific components of these practices, the authors can examine how different aspects of formative assessment influence student learning outcomes.\n\nFor instance, the authors include studies that use feedback as a formative assessment strategy, as feedback is an essential component of formative assessment. They also include studies that investigate the use of pretest feedback, as this is another crucial aspect of formative assessment. By analyzing the effectiveness of these specific formative assessment practices, the authors can identify which ones are most effective in improving student learning outcomes."

Additionally, sustainable assessment practices might prioritize feedback processes and building capacity for students to make judgments of their own work, particularly at early and mid stages of the course. Finally, sustainable assessment practices should emphasize the assurance and portrayal of learning, rather than simply relying on summative evaluations."

Instructors can design assessment tasks to support student learning and development by breaking down tasks into smaller activities over time, engaging students in identifying criteria for success, and incorporating formative assessments into later summative ones.\n\nTo further support student learning, instructors can use assessment tasks to focus student attention on disciplinary outcomes, and scaffold students to develop their judgement. Additionally, instructors should be mindful that assessment is relational and that there are no intrinsic qualities of the task or method of assessment that guarantee a certain learning outcome. Instead, the approach and intentions of the student will impact the learning outcome. By understanding these key features and principles of sustainable assessment, instructors can design assessment tasks that align with student learning and development, and support the development of informed judgement and self-assessment skills."

These activities can be designed to require students to communicate, negotiate, and coordinate their efforts, demonstrating their ability to collaborate and solve complex problems.\n\nSecondly, technology can be used to provide real-time feedback to students on their progress and performance, helping them develop their self-regulation skills. For example, technology can be used to provide immediate feedback on students' answers, highlighting areas where they need improvement and suggesting resources to help them improve. Additionally, technology can be used to provide students with personalized learning paths and adaptive assessments that adjust their difficulty and content based on students' performance, helping them stay motivated and engaged in their learning.\n\nFurthermore, technology can be used to analyze process data generated by technology-enhanced formative assessments, providing insights into students' learning behaviors and self-regulatory strategies. For instance, moment-by-moment learning curves (MBMLCs) can be used to evaluate the impact of formative assessment on students' non-content-specific skills, such as self-regulation. This can help educators identify areas where students may need additional support or scaffolding, and adjust their teaching methods accordingly.\n\nOverall, technology can be a powerful tool to support the assessment of transversal skills, such as collaborative problem-solving and self-regulation, in formative assessment, providing real-time feedback, facilitating collaborative activities, and analyzing process data to inform instruction."

However, there are also limitations to consider, such as potential biases in student self-assessment and the need for further research on the effectiveness of self-assessment in diverse populations and learning contexts.\n\nOne potential benefit of self-assessment is that it can promote greater student engagement and motivation in the learning process. By giving students the opportunity to reflect on their own learning and set their own goals, they may become more invested in their educational experiences and more likely to take ownership of their learning. Additionally, self-assessment can help students develop important metacognitive skills, such as the ability to evaluate their own learning and identify areas for improvement.\n\nHowever, there are also potential limitations to incorporating self-assessment into the teaching and learning process. One limitation is that students may not always have the necessary skills or knowledge to effectively assess their own learning, leading to potential biases in their self-assessments. Additionally, self-assessment may not be effective in all learning contexts, particularly in situations where students lack the necessary resources or support to engage in meaningful self-assessment.\n\nTo explore these benefits and limitations further, future research could investigate the effectiveness of self-assessment in diverse populations and learning contexts. For example, research could examine the impact of self-assessment on student learning outcomes in different subject areas, or compare the effectiveness of self-assessment in face-to-face and online learning environments. Additionally, research could explore the potential role of self-assessment in promoting equity and inclusivity in education, by examining how self-assessment practices may vary across different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Overall, a deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations of self-assessment can inform pedagogical and practical recommendations for teachers and educators seeking to promote effective learning and assessment practices in their classrooms."

The framework posits that there are two levels of cognition: the object level, which includes task-relevant knowledge and automated strategies, and the meta-level, which includes models of the task and cognitive operations necessary to perform it. Monitoring and control signals flow between these two levels, with the meta-level monitoring cognition and thoughts at the object level and initiating, altering, or terminating mental and physical actions as needed. The goal of this cycle is to achieve learning goals through the repetition of this monitoring-control process."

Specifically, the use of formative assessment by teachers was found to be beneficial for students' motivation. The study also found that students who perceived their teachers as using classroom discussions as a formative assessment strategy had higher levels of both autonomous and controlled motivation. However, the study did not find an association between the use of other formative assessment strategies and students' controlled motivation. Overall, the findings suggest that the way classroom discussions are applied by teachers matters, and that the use of formative assessment practices can positively impact students' motivation."

They continuously check for alignment during the design process, looking at the learning objectives, assessment, and lesson activities collectively. They also believe that checking for coherence and alignment should continue after the design process during and after the execution of the formative assessment plan.\n\nTo ensure alignment, the teachers consider all three components - learning objectives, lesson activities, and assessments - together during the planning process. They use this integrated approach to determine whether lesson planning needs to be adjusted based on the choices made in designing formative assessment, while simultaneously determining how formative assessment can enhance learning. Additionally, they believe that checking for coherence and alignment should be an ongoing process, both during and after the execution of the formative assessment plan. This ensures that the formative assessment plan is flexible and adaptable to meet the changing needs of students and the learning objectives."

The researchers controlled for possible differences in prior achievement by using \"input\" measures such as school test scores from the previous year or other measures of aptitude. They also calculated the standardized effect size by taking the difference between the scores of the experimental and control groups and dividing it by the standard deviation of the scores. The average effect size was around 0.3 standard deviations, which suggests that the formative assessment strategies improved the students' results and raised the school's performance from the lower quartile to well above average."

Secondly, comments should be used to identify what has been done well and what still needs improvement, and provide guidance on how to make improvements. Additionally, opportunities for students to respond to comments should be planned as part of the overall learning process. This can be achieved by devoting some lesson time to rewriting selected pieces of work, allowing students to receive feedback in a supportive environment. Moreover, teachers can eliminate, modify, or seek out new tasks that actively promote understanding and improvement. Finally, the implementation of these reforms can change both teachers' and students' attitudes towards written work, shifting the assessment of students' work from a competitive and summative judgment to a distinctive step in the process of learning."

Firstly, the framework breaks down learning objectives into constituent skills within each level based on skill hierarchy relationships, allowing for the establishment of a comprehensive and measurable assessment indicator system. Secondly, the formative assessment process is integrated into the tasks of schema construction, schema proficiency, and comprehensive application and transfer, based on the 4C/ID model. This allows for the monitoring and promotion of students' learning process through conceptual knowledge tests, process tests, rule tests, and comprehensive project tests. Additionally, the human-machine collaborative assessment environment can effectively implement evaluation tasks and collect, process, and provide feedback on learning process data. Finally, the comprehensive transfer task of complex skills in the summative evaluation can verify the effectiveness of the formative assessment for the whole complex skill learning process."

Second, they may not use conversations with their students to discover the best suitable follow-up, which can limit the potential of formative assessment to support student development and learning. To avoid these pitfalls, teachers should broaden their formative decisions to include \"what is the best way to move forward?\" and incorporate both \"yes or no\" and \"how to continue\" decisions in their formative assessment plans.

      "content": "Providing immediate feedback in an iterative fashion to students in a skills-based course can be challenging due to the risk of hindering effective learning. One approach to address this challenge is to use a \"Try Once, Refine Once\" design pattern, which involves allowing students to attempt a task or exercise once before receiving feedback, and then refining their responses based on the feedback received. This approach can help students to identify and correct their mistakes without becoming overly reliant on the feedback, and can promote deeper learning and understanding of the material. Additionally, using this approach can help to prevent the fossilization of errors and misconceptions, as students are encouraged to actively engage with the material and reflect on their own learning. To implement this pattern effectively, instructors can use a variety of assessment types, such as multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, and open-ended questions, and can provide detailed feedback indicating the source and type of each error, without revealing exactly what must be done to correct them. By using this approach, instructors can create a supportive learning environment that fosters student engagement, motivation, and learning."

Additionally, incorporating technology-enhanced tools and resources can help streamline the assessment process and provide more timely and targeted feedback to students. However, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as the potential for increased workload and the need for ongoing training and support to ensure that teachers are equipped to facilitate emotionally positive and emotionally aware learning environments. Moreover, there may be a perception among some lecturers that student engagement with feedback is limited, which could reduce the motivation and investment of teachers in providing feedback to students.

Relevance: Ensure that the assessment tasks are relevant to the subject matter and the real-world applications of the discipline. This can be achieved by consulting with professionals in the field and using authentic examples and scenarios.\n2. Authenticity: Use authentic and relevant examples and scenarios to illustrate the concepts and skills being assessed. For example, instead of using hypothetical case studies, use real-life legal cases or historical events that students can analyze and apply their knowledge to.\n3. Iterativity: Incorporate iterative processes into the assessment tasks, such as multiple drafts or revisions, to mirror the way professionals in the field work.\n4. Feedback: Provide timely and constructive feedback to students on their performance, just as professionals in the field would receive feedback on their work. This can be done through peer review, self-assessment, or instructor feedback.\n5. Student choice and autonomy: Allow students to have some choice and autonomy in selecting the topics or scenarios they want to explore, as this can increase their motivation and engagement in the assessment tasks.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies into their assessment tasks, instructors can create a more authentic and meaningful learning experience for their students, one that better prepares them for real-life applications of the discipline."

Irrelevance of pass marks: Setting a pass mark does not establish a standard, as it does not indicate what a student can or cannot do.\n4. Meaninglessness of grades: Grades that do not address specific learning outcomes are inconsequential, as they do not convey information about a student's abilities.\n5.

In the medical culture, feedback was seen as less central to learning, and participants felt that feedback was often not provided in a timely or supportive manner. In contrast, participants in the education and music cultures expected constant observation and feedback, and valued the use of observation, feedforward, and action plans to improve the credibility of feedback.\n\nThe findings of this study have several implications for the design of feedback processes in medical education. Firstly, the importance of timely and supportive feedback cannot be overstated, and medical educators should strive to provide feedback that is both credible and constructive. Secondly, the use of observation, feedforward, and action plans can help to improve the effectiveness of feedback and increase its perceived value by learners. Finally, the study highlights the need for medical educators to recognize the unique challenges and limitations of providing feedback within the medical macrosystem, where the primary job of clinical teachers is to treat patients rather than provide dedicated teaching. By understanding these challenges and limitations, medical educators can work to create a more supportive and effective learning environment for their students."

With the adoption of explicit academic standards and discipline learning outcomes, assessment is now focused on judging whether students can demonstrate attainment of these learning outcomes to a given standard. This requires assessment to be closely aligned with the learning outcomes and to be used to provide useful information to students to help them meet these outcomes.\n\nTo meet multiple purposes of assessment, it is necessary to design assessment activities that are spread across the semester and the program, rather than relying on a single assessment task. This allows for a range of assessment methods to be used, including formative assessment tasks that provide feedback to students and contribute to their self-regulated learning, as well as summative assessment tasks that are used to evaluate student achievement at the end of the program.\n\nIn order to ensure that all purposes of assessment are successfully and compatibly pursued, it is important to carefully consider the timing of tasks, the provision of different types of information, and the kinds of activity that surround tasks. For example, formative assessment tasks may be used primarily for feedback and self-regulation, while summative assessment tasks may be used primarily for grading and evaluating student achievement.\n\nAdditionally, assessment should be designed in the context of the overall educational design of programs, taking into account the learning outcomes and the goals of the program. This requires careful consideration of the balance between formative and summative assessment, as well as the use of a variety of assessment methods to meet the diverse needs of students. By carefully designing assessment activities to meet multiple purposes, educators can provide valuable information to students, help them to progress in their learning, and ensure that they are achieving the desired learning outcomes."

Firstly, it can provide more nuanced information about student learning than traditional multiple-choice or constructed-response items. This is because technology-enhanced assessments can include extended and dynamic contexts such as problem-solving and inquiry tasks, which can better capture the complex nature of STEM concepts. Additionally, technology-enhanced assessments can automate the feedback process for students, allowing for differentiation based on individual students' outcomes. Finally, technology-enhanced assessments can enhance collaborative learning among students, as they can work together on assessment tasks using mobile devices and other digital tools."

Teachers should take responsibility for serving the summative purposes, or at least play an active part in meeting this responsibility.\n\nThese three components are interdependent, meaning that achieving one component can help achieve the others. For instance, using a contextual value-added system can help ensure that accountability is based on factors within the control of teachers and schools, which can then lead to the development of assessment instruments that support learning. Similarly, taking responsibility for serving the summative purposes can help ensure that assessment instruments are designed in a way that supports learning."

By understanding the multiplicity of factors that influence feedback interactions, academics can design feedback interactions that set up students for success in their professional formation. Additionally, the ecological model emphasizes the importance of establishing trust, aligning goals, and using feedback to promote learning and development, rather than simply focusing on telling learners what they did wrong. For learners, the ecological model suggests that effective feedback practices are not just about receiving feedback from teachers, but also about developing the skills and dispositions necessary to seek out and use feedback effectively throughout their professional formation."

The Q statistic for the fixed effects meta-analysis was 169.46, which was statistically significant at well beyond the .0001 level, indicating that the observed effects were not due to chance. The variability in effect sizes was much greater than can be explained by the sampling of examinees across studies, suggesting that there are other factors that contribute to the nonchance variation in outcomes.\n\nThe moderator analyses revealed that two of the three moderator variables were significant: content area and treatment type. Content area appeared to explain most of the nonchance variation, while the effect of treatment type was small and statistically significant only in the context of content area. The results suggest that the success of educational interventions may depend on the specific content being taught, as well as the type of treatment used. However, the small number of effect sizes and the large number of potential moderator variables limit the interpretability of these findings.\n\nIn conclusion, the meta-analysis found a small to medium effect size for educational interventions, with the majority of the nonchance variation in outcomes attributed to content area. The results highlight the importance of considering the specific content and treatment type when designing and implementing educational interventions."

When the student doesn't respond immediately, the teacher reformulates the question by repeating \"How do you think it went yourself?\" (line 05) with a rising intonation, which encourages the student to provide an answer.\n\nSecondly, the teacher uses a hesitation marker \"e:\" (line 07) to indicate that the student is uncertain about their response, and then follows up with a mitigating phrase \"I believe\" (line 08) to show support and encourage the student to share their thoughts. The teacher also uses a final rising intonation at the end of line 08 to invite the student to provide more information.\n\nFinally, the teacher provides an account of the student's presentation, framing it as a new experience for the student (lines 10-11), which serves as a disclaimer and implies that the student's nervousness is understandable. This prompts the student to provide an account of their own experience, and the teacher uses a final rising intonation at the end of line 13 to invite further elaboration. Overall, the teacher's strategies aim to create a safe and supportive environment for the student to reflect on their own performance and provide self-assessment."

Synthesizing research is a subjective process, as the significance attached to each study and the general conclusions drawn from conflicting findings will inevitably be subjective.\n3. Reviewing research is not a derivative form of scholarship, but rather it can serve to reconceptualize, organize, and focus research, generating a momentum for work in the field that would be difficult to create otherwise.

One benefit is the timely provision of feedback to students, which can be facilitated by technology in a more efficient manner than traditional teacher-led assessment (Spector et al., 2016). Additionally, digital formative assessment allows for greater opportunities for self/peer assessment and student collaboration, as well as support for learner choice in assessment and access for students with disabilities (Looney, 2019). Furthermore, digital technologies can measure constructs and processes that were previously inaccessible, rendering them potentially transformative for the science of assessment (Shute et al., 2016). Finally, digital formative assessment can facilitate the seamless integration of formative and summative assessment, allowing teachers to assess student progress throughout the learning process and provide targeted feedback to improve student outcomes."

One major issue is that students may not view peer assessment as part of their role, leading to lack of engagement and negative attitudes towards the process. Additionally, students may not possess the necessary expertise to provide reliable feedback, which can lead to inaccurate or unhelpful assessments. To address these challenges, educators must establish a culture shift towards peer assessment, emphasizing its benefits and the importance of students' active participation. Moreover, students need to be trained and supported in providing high-quality feedback, and assessment designs should be carefully crafted to ensure students have the necessary knowledge to assess reliably. Finally, educators can explore innovative approaches like intelligent tutoring systems, automated online assessment, and audience response systems to alleviate the workload associated with tutor marking of drafts and tutor-student dialogue."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Cognitive appraisal theory posits that emotions are the result of an individual's interpretation of a situation, rather than the situation itself. In the context of feedback, students may experience different emotions based on their appraisal of the feedback they receive. For instance, if a student perceives the feedback as being unfair or unhelpful, they may experience anger or frustration, whereas if they view the feedback as constructive and helpful, they may experience gratitude or motivation.\n\nAccording to cognitive appraisal theory, there are three key components to appraisal: the situation/concern, the person's goal relevance, and the perceived cause of the situation. These components can influence the emotional response of the student. For example, if a student perceives the feedback as being related to their goals and feels that they have control over the situation, they may experience less negative emotions. On the other hand, if they perceive the feedback as being unrelated to their goals or feel that they have no control over the situation, they may experience more negative emotions.\n\nCognitive appraisal theory can help educators understand the emotional experiences of students in response to feedback by identifying the underlying causes of their emotions. By understanding the appraisal process, educators can tailor their feedback to better align with the student's goals and increase the likelihood of a positive emotional response. Additionally, educators can use this theory to identify situations where students may be more likely to experience negative emotions, such as when feedback is perceived as being too critical or unhelpful, and take steps to mitigate these effects. Overall, cognitive appraisal theory provides a useful framework for educators to understand the emotional experiences of students in response to feedback and to develop strategies to promote a more positive emotional response."

Teacher feedback may also trigger students to study or review certain aspects of the material more than others, depending on their interests or the emphasis placed by the teacher. Moreover, teacher feedback has been found to motivate girls in particular to learn, as they have a positive attitude towards teacher feedback and are aware of its quality, which improves their perceptions of competence and metacognitive skills. As a result, teacher feedback during formative assessments with SRS leads to higher scores on summative assessments and improved comprehension of course material."

      "content": "The author's main argument is that relying solely on pre-set criteria in assessment can hinder the development of a conception of quality among students. According to the author, pre-set criteria can filter out important aspects of quality that are not explicitly addressed in the criteria, leading to a narrow and limited understanding of quality. Instead, the author suggests that students need to evaluate authentic work repeatedly to develop a conceptualization of quality. However, the author also acknowledges that students need explicit criteria to know what to look for in authentic work. Therefore, the author proposes an integration of both approaches, using rubrics as a scaffolding structure to help students learn to identify indicators of quality in authentic work while also encouraging them to develop their own understanding of quality through repeated evaluation.\n\nThe author highlights the importance of providing students with opportunities to evaluate authentic work in order to develop their understanding of quality. This is because authentic work often involves complex and nuanced aspects of quality that may not be captured by pre-set criteria. By repeatedly evaluating authentic work, students can gain a deeper understanding of what constitutes quality and develop the ability to recognize it in different contexts. The author also notes that confident students may choose not to use rubrics, preferring to rely on their own understanding of quality. However, low-performing/low-confidence students may benefit from the support provided by rubrics, which can help them develop their understanding of quality over time."

Student-centered approach: Peer-assessment is valuable because students may accept criticisms of their work from their peers that they might not take seriously from their teacher.\n3. Natural language use: Peer work is valuable because the interchange will be in language that students themselves would naturally use.\n4. Role-taking: Students learn by taking the roles of teachers and examiners of others.\n5. Guidance: Many students need guidance on how to behave in groups, such as listening to one another, taking turns, and offering affirmation together with constructive criticism about one another's work.\n6. Differentiated feedback: Students who are unsure of their success can receive differentiated feedback based on the color-coding system of \"traffic lights,\" with red indicating total or partial uncertainty, amber indicating partial understanding, and green indicating confidence.\n7. Teacher support: The teacher pays special attention to those who have chosen red, providing additional support and guidance as needed.\n\nBy incorporating these key elements into peer-assessment activities, students can develop their capacity for meta-cognitive thinking, improve their understanding of the learning goals and criteria, and enhance their ability to self-assess and evaluate their own work effectively."

Firstly, feedback should be focused on articulating ultimate goals for students, providing them with an indication of their progress, and showing them where they should move to next (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Effective feedback should be directed towards the instructional goal, rather than focusing on the student as a person. It should also be timely, allowing students to reflect on and use the feedback during the lesson. Additionally, feedback related to process and self-regulation is considered most helpful in advancing student learning, while limited task-oriented feedback may also be useful (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Finally, time is essential for both the provision of feedback and for students to make sense of and use the feedback (Cowie et al., 2013)."

      "content": "The Dialogic Feedback Cycle (DFC) is a model for assessment feedback that consists of three stages: preparatory guidance, in-task guidance, and performance feedback. To enhance the feedback process, technology can be incorporated into each stage of the cycle.\n\nPreparatory Guidance: This stage involves providing students with guidance on what to expect during the assessment task and how to approach it. Technology can be used to provide students with online resources, such as tutorials or videos, that explain the task requirements and expectations. Additionally, technology can be used to facilitate communication between instructors and students, such as through email or messaging platforms, to provide individualized guidance and support.\n\nIn-Task Guidance: During this stage, students are engaged in the assessment task and may require guidance and support while they work. Technology can be used to provide real-time feedback and support, such as through online chat or discussion forums, where students can ask questions and receive immediate responses from instructors or peers.\n\nPerformance Feedback: After the assessment task is completed, technology can be used to provide students with feedback on their performance. This can include automated feedback, such as through online quizzes or grading tools, as well as personalized feedback from instructors, which can be delivered through technology-mediated channels such as video conferencing or online messaging.\n\nIncorporating technology into each stage of the DFC can enhance the feedback process by providing students with more flexible and personalized support, as well as allowing instructors to more efficiently deliver feedback to large numbers of students. For example, technology can be used to track student progress and provide targeted feedback based on individual needs, or to facilitate peer review and feedback among students. However, it is important to ensure that technology is used in a way that is constructively aligned with the learning objectives and process, and that it does not detract from the quality of the feedback received by students."

First, the simulation environment lacks real patients and the responsibilities that come with them, which can affect the dynamics of the learning experience. Additionally, the primary focus of simulation-based learning is typically on student learning, whereas in clinical settings, patient care is the primary focus. This means that feedback time can be scheduled and prioritized in a way that is not possible in clinical settings. Furthermore, the credibility of feedback in the simulation environment may be influenced by the fact that it is provided by non-medical practitioners, such as nurses, who are no longer working in the clinical environment. This can affect learners' credibility judgments of the feedback they receive. Overall, these differences highlight the importance of considering the unique characteristics of the simulation learning environment when designing formative assessment strategies."

Firstly, it reduces anxiety and increases confidence among students, particularly for shy or anxious students, as they do not have to worry about being noticed by others. This is because the anonymity of SRS allows students to respond without fear of judgment or embarrassment. Secondly, it facilitates students' cognitive skills development by allowing them to spend more time on problem-solving and double-checking their answers before submitting them. This leads to improved meta-cognitive awareness and increased commitment of resources to answer problems correctly. Additionally, anonymous polling eliminates the effect of students waiting for others before deciding their answer, which can result in a more stringent monitoring and control process. Overall, the use of anonymous polling in formative assessments with SRS can lead to more effective learning outcomes and improved student engagement."

At the end of the lesson, he would collect the whiteboards and review the responses to identify common misconceptions or areas where students struggled. He also used exit passes, where students would write their responses to questions on a piece of paper and hand it in at the end of the lesson. This allowed him to gather information about every student's learning needs, not just those who volunteered to answer questions.\n\nBased on the information gathered from these strategies, Fredric would adjust his teaching practices to better meet the learning needs of his students. For example, if he noticed that many students were struggling with a particular concept, he might adjust the instructional activities to focus on that area or provide additional support. He also used the information to select or adjust tasks for individual students to work on, based on their learning needs. Additionally, he provided written feedback to students, communicating two things they had done well and one specific suggestion for improvement, which helped to reinforce their learning and encourage self-improvement. Overall, Fredric's use of formative assessment strategies and feedback helped to create a more personalized and effective learning environment for his students."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To effectively use formative assessment to inform instruction and improve student learning outcomes, a teacher can follow a few key strategies. First, the teacher should align the learning objectives, lesson activities, and assessment activities to ensure coherence and consistency throughout the instructional process. This alignment helps to focus the teacher's attention on the most important learning goals and ensures that students are engaged in meaningful and relevant activities that support those goals.\n\nSecond, the teacher should collect data about student learning that is directly linked to a predetermined formative decision about the next steps in teaching and learning. This means that the teacher should use assessment tasks that elicit information about student learning that can be used to inform immediate decisions about instruction. For example, the teacher might use a formative assessment task to identify areas where students are struggling or to determine whether students have mastered a particular skill or concept.\n\nThird, the teacher should leave room for adjustment and improvement, both for themselves and for their students. This means that the teacher should be open to adjusting their instruction based on the information they gather from formative assessments, and should also provide opportunities for students to revise and improve their work based on feedback. By doing so, the teacher creates a dynamic and responsive learning environment that is focused on continuous improvement and growth.\n\nTo implement these strategies effectively, the teacher might consider using a variety of formative assessment techniques, such as quizzes, class discussions, and formative writing assignments. The teacher might also use technology tools, such as online quizzes or digital portfolios, to streamline the formative assessment process and provide more timely and targeted feedback to students.\n\nOverall, using formative assessment to inform instruction and improve student learning outcomes requires careful planning, intentional instruction, and a willingness to adapt and adjust based on the needs of students. By following these strategies, a teacher can create a powerful learning environment that is centered on the needs and abilities of all students."

Firstly, the study was conducted with a convenience sample of students who were all from Israel and studied at teacher training colleges specializing in science education. To address this limitation, future research could recruit participants from a wider range of geographic and cultural backgrounds, and include students from different fields of study. Additionally, the study only included students enrolled in face-to-face classes, and future research could explore self-assessment in the online environment.\n\nAnother limitation of the study is that it focused solely on summative self-assessment, and did not examine formative self-assessment or self-assessment with criteria defined by the student. Future research could expand the research design to include these aspects of self-assessment, and examine how they differ from one another. Moreover, the study relied solely on written self-reports from the students, and did not incorporate personal interviews or observations of the students' involvement in the assessment process. Incorporating these methods could provide a more comprehensive understanding of students' perceptions regarding self-assessment.\n\nTo address these limitations, future research could also consider combining multiple methods, such as surveys, interviews, and observations, to gather a richer and more nuanced understanding of self-assessment in higher education. Additionally, researchers could explore the use of technology to facilitate self-assessment, such as online tools for setting and tracking learning goals, or peer review and feedback mechanisms. By addressing these limitations and exploring new approaches, future research can deepen our understanding of self-assessment in higher education and provide practical recommendations for teachers."

The study also found indirect effects of the perceptions of formative assessment strategies on motivation through need satisfaction and frustration. Specifically, the use of clarifying criteria, teacher feedback, and self and peer assessment was found to increase need satisfaction, which in turn was associated with higher levels of autonomous motivation. On the other hand, the use of classroom discussions was found to increase frustration, which was associated with lower levels of autonomous motivation."

Additionally, the program should embed the training course in a virtual practice community where teachers can share materials, experiences, ideas, and difficulties, and receive support from their colleagues. This community aspect is particularly important during pandemic times when face-to-face interactions may be limited. Another key consideration is providing ongoing support to teachers after the training course, such as through a continuous training program and a practice community with other expert teachers, to help them feel sustained in their efforts to implement AFA in their classrooms. Finally, the program should include active learning and job-embedded practices to help teachers apply their learning in real-world contexts and improve their teaching skills over time."

While it cannot be determined with certainty that the increased emphasis on formative assessment was responsible for the improvement in students' scores, the findings suggest that formative assessment may be an effective strategy for raising achievement. Additionally, the study found that formative assessment appeared to increase students' \"mindfulness,\" which can lead to improved long-term retention and higher-order skill development."

These changes were implemented to a limited extent, as the teacher only incorporated three new activities into their practice.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher who implemented the most new activities made significant changes to their practice, including using a variety of formative assessment strategies, providing ongoing feedback, and using technology to support formative assessment. These changes were implemented extensively, as the teacher incorporated nine new activities into their practice.\n\nOverall, the analysis of the two teachers' changes in formative assessment practice provides a picture of the range of changes that can be made in classroom practice to improve teaching and learning."

Additionally, the marking process can be heavily influenced by tradition, making it difficult to implement change (Deneen & Boud, 2014). Another challenge is that the use of learning portfolios is less common for whole programs than for course units, and hard-copy portfolios can be unwieldy and difficult to transform for different purposes (Clarke & Boud, submitted for publication).\n\nTo address these challenges, institutions can start by identifying and clarifying desired learning outcomes for their programs and units, and ensuring that these outcomes are consistently applied across all assessments (Deneen & Boud, 2014). This can involve revising existing assessment methods and processes to better align with the new framework, and providing training and support for faculty and staff to ensure a successful transition. Additionally, institutions can explore the use of electronic portfolios to facilitate the collection, storage, and analysis of student work, and to enable multiple transformations for different purposes (Clarke & Boud, submitted for publication). By taking a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to implementing a standards-based or outcome-oriented assessment framework, institutions can overcome these challenges and improve the quality and effectiveness of their assessment practices."

Therefore, they suggest that a theory of pedagogy is essential to provide a comprehensive understanding of formative assessment.\n\nThe authors also highlight the limitations of previous research on formative assessment, which has primarily focused on practical implementations without a solid theoretical foundation. They argue that building a coherent theory of formative assessment is a complex and challenging task, requiring a broader theoretical framework.

The methodology involved a sequence of collaborative workshops where project participants shared their experiences in the form of case stories, and then used these case stories as a basis for constructing design patterns. The first two workshops focused on sharing experiences and constructing case stories, while the third and fourth workshops evaluated these patterns by applying them to problem scenarios. The final workshop involved software developers who were not part of the earlier process, and engaged them in design tasks based on the cases and patterns produced. This approach ensured that the developed cases and patterns were grounded in practical experience and were able to address real-world challenges and problems in technology applications aimed at supporting assessment for learning."

Secondly, comments should be used to identify what has been done well and what still needs improvement, and provide guidance on how to make improvements. Additionally, opportunities for students to respond to comments should be planned as part of the overall learning process. This can be achieved by devoting some lesson time to rewriting selected pieces of work, allowing students to receive feedback in a supportive environment. Moreover, teachers can eliminate, modify, or seek out new tasks that actively promote understanding and improvement. Finally, the implementation of these reforms can change both teachers' and students' attitudes towards written work, shifting the assessment of students' work from a competitive and summative judgment to a distinctive step in the process of learning."

To address these challenges, educators can establish clear guidelines and expectations for peer assessment, provide training and support for students, use technology to facilitate the process, and carefully design assessments to ensure that students have the necessary knowledge and skills to provide reliable feedback. By taking these steps, educators can maximize the benefits of peer assessment and promote effective learning experiences for their students."

This encouraged students to take ownership of their learning and work collaboratively to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nSecondly, Monica employed open-ended questions to elicit evidence from students that set the stage for knowledge construction. For instance, when asking the students why we should study photosynthesis, she prompted them to think critically about the significance of photosynthesis in our daily lives and its impact on our environment.\n\nLastly, Monica facilitated collaborative discussions within the home groups, allowing students to share their understanding of the topic with their peers. This promoted peer-to-peer learning and encouraged students to build upon each other's ideas, leading to a deeper understanding of cellular biology.\n\nThrough these strategies, Monica created an inclusive and interactive learning environment that valued the perspectives and contributions of all students. By giving students the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions and activities, she helped them develop a more profound understanding of cellular biology and its practical applications in our daily lives."

Additionally, the emphasis on external evaluation and feedback may undermine students' sense of competence and self-evaluation. Furthermore, the focus on meeting standards and expectations rather than exploring interests and passions may limit students' opportunities for relatedness and a sense of belonging in the classroom."

      "content": "Students often use various cues to monitor their learning, such as the amount of time spent studying, the subjective ease of processing information, and the feeling of familiarity with a solution strategy. However, not all cues are equally diagnostic or accurate. According to Koriat's cue-utilization framework, cues that are predictive of subsequent test performance are the most useful for monitoring learning. These cues include accurate solution strategies coming to mind quickly, the extent to which students can recall information without hesitation, and the feeling of difficulty or familiarity in recognizing a solution strategy.\n\nTo ensure that students are using diagnostic and accurate cues, educators can align formative assessments closely with summative assessments, as this can help students develop a better understanding of what will be tested and focus their attention on the most important learning goals. Additionally, educators can provide feedback to students on their performance, highlighting areas where they may need to improve and encouraging them to use more effective solution strategies. Finally, educators can encourage students to reflect on their own learning and identify areas where they may need to spend more time or effort to achieve mastery. By promoting the use of diagnostic cues, educators can help students become more effective learners and improve the overall effectiveness of their teaching."

Another strategy is to design feedback interactions that are embedded in the broader learning ecosystem, taking into account the perspectives of all stakeholders and the cultural and institutional context.\n\nTo align these strategies with the ecological model, higher education institutions might consider the following steps:\n\n1. Establish a culture of continuous improvement: Encourage a growth mindset among all stakeholders, where feedback is seen as an opportunity for growth and development rather than criticism.\n2. Foster collaboration and communication among stakeholders: Encourage academics, learners, and administrators to work together to design feedback interactions that are aligned with the needs of all parties.\n3. Embed feedback practices in the broader learning ecosystem: Ensure that feedback practices are integrated into the curriculum, assessment, and pedagogy, and that they are aligned with the broader goals of the institution.\n4. Develop a shared language and understanding of feedback: Provide training and resources to help all stakeholders understand the purposes and goals of feedback, and how to give and receive feedback effectively.\n5. Focus on the development of self-regulation skills: Encourage learners to take an active role in seeking out and applying feedback, and to develop their own self-regulation skills through deliberate practice and reflection.\n6. Consider the emotional legacy of feedback interactions: Recognize the potential impact of feedback interactions on learners' developing professional identities, and take steps to mitigate any negative effects."

These briefings were compiled by the project team and featured key elements of effective practice, including case examples from a range of subject areas. Additionally, five of the briefings were specially commissioned from recognized experts, either by adapting and reprinting high-quality published material or by contracting accessible introductions to more substantial material available from published sources.\n2. Face-to-face events: The project organized a series of \"join-the-conversation\" events, publicized university-wide to encourage boundary crossing and participation from a diverse range of faculty and staff. These events featured panels of experts, including the originators of case examples and student representatives, and focused on dialogue and interchange rather than formal presentations.\n3. Digital videos: The project produced two types of digital videos. The first was a \"vox pop\" featuring 20 HKU students discussing their experiences of receiving feedback on assignments and assessments. The second was a set of \"talking heads\" videos, each featuring a short, edited recording of an interview with a prominent scholar sharing their insights on assessment for learning.\n\nOverall, the Wise Assessment Project's outputs were designed to provide a range of choices for faculty and staff seeking to improve their assessment practices, and to foster a culture of assessment for learning across the university."

According to Koriat's cue-utilization framework, cues that are predictive of subsequent test performance are those that accurately reflect the mental representation of the learning material that will be assessed at testing.\n\nTo ensure that students are using accurate cues to monitor their learning, teachers can align formative assessments closely with summative assessments. This can help students develop a deeper understanding of the course content and improve their ability to recognize and apply solution strategies, rather than simply relying on recognition of previous questions. Additionally, teachers can provide feedback on students' use of cues and encourage them to focus on diagnostic cues, such as the extent to which accurate solution strategies come to mind in a limited amount of time, rather than non-diagnostic cues, such as recognizing multiple-choice questions from previous formative assessments. By promoting the use of diagnostic cues, teachers can help students make more accurate monitoring judgments and improve the effectiveness of their control decisions."

They searched these terms in electronic databases such as ERIC, Education Full Text, PsycInfo, Computers & Applied Sciences Complete, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. They also used backward referencing to identify additional studies. The authors only included peer-reviewed articles and conference presentations that were published in the last 20 years. To select relevant studies, they applied inclusion criteria such as the system having an explicit purpose of providing feedback to students or instructors based on data collected in the course, the system capturing student data digitally, and the articles reporting on implemented formative assessment systems rather than theoretical designs. They excluded articles that did not meet these criteria, resulting in 28 total articles for review. The authors coded the articles for the type of data collected, the method used to process the data, and how the processed data were presented to the instructor or student for the purpose of formative assessment. They also independently examined 20% of the articles and achieved 80% initial agreement before clarifying the coding definitions and achieving complete agreement on the remaining articles."

The underlying principles include the provision of feedback, the assessment of hard-to-measure constructs, and the inclusion of new item types capable of providing more nuanced information about learning. Best practices include considering four types of learning for building critical skills in STEM, such as problem and research-based learning, enquiry-based learning, collaborative learning, and mobile learning. Additionally, the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, the Formative Assessment in Science and Mathematics Education (FaSMEd) model, and the digital literacy model can be used to frame digital formative assessment.\n\nThe potential benefits of using technology in formative assessment include automation of the feedback process, access for students with disabilities, and greater opportunities for student collaboration. However, there are also challenges such as the need for adequate support and training for teachers in the implementation of technology-enhanced formative assessment systems, and the importance of ensuring that the use of technology does not compromise the validity of the assessment process.\n\nIn order to implement digital formative assessment effectively in STEM education, it is important to consider the specific needs and goals of the curriculum and the learners, and to carefully select and use appropriate technologies that align with these goals. Additionally, ongoing professional development for teachers and students is essential to ensure that they have the necessary technological competencies and literacies to effectively integrate technology into the assessment process."

These strategies are introduced through workshops, seminars, and professional studies, where trainees learn about different assessment methods and how to use them to inform their teaching practices. During their school experiences, trainees observe experienced teachers (mentors) delivering assessments and have the opportunity to plan and teach lessons that incorporate assessment strategies they have learned. The mentors provide expert feedback to the trainees, focusing on how they are carrying out assessments in their classrooms.\n\nOverall, the ITE program places a strong emphasis on practical experience and the application of theoretical knowledge in real-world settings.

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The assessment methods used by the teachers have several limitations that can have negative consequences for student learning. Firstly, the teachers' reliance on summative assessment, where they provide general and brief comments without explaining the strengths and weaknesses of the work, fails to promote deep learning and understanding. This type of assessment focuses solely on the end product rather than the process of learning, which hinders students' ability to reflect on their progress and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, the lack of specific feedback and references to past achievements means that students are not provided with the necessary information to self-assess their learning effectively.\n\nAnother limitation of the assessment methods is the failure to distinguish between formative and summative assessment. As a result, teachers are not using assessment as a tool for promoting learning, but rather as a way to evaluate student performance at the end of a lesson or unit. This can lead to a culture of testing and evaluation rather than one of learning and development. Furthermore, the high teacher-pupil ratio and lack of time mentioned by the teachers can limit the frequency of formative assessment, which is essential for effective learning.\n\nThe potential consequences of these limitations are significant. Students may not receive the timely and targeted feedback they need to improve their learning, leading to a lack of progress and motivation. Moreover, the emphasis on competition and evaluation can create a stressful learning environment that undermines the development of a growth mindset. Finally, the lack of focus on process and progress can lead to a narrow definition of success based solely on grades and achievement, rather than a more holistic view of learning that values effort, creativity, and critical thinking."

This step helps ensure that the assessment plan is aligned with the learning objectives and that the teachers have a clear understanding of what they want their students to achieve.\n\nStep 2: Developing Assessment Strategies - Once the learning goals and success criteria are identified, experienced teachers develop assessment strategies that will measure student progress towards achieving those goals. This step involves selecting appropriate assessment methods and tools, such as quizzes, tests, or project-based assessments, that will provide valuable data on student learning.\n\nStep 3: Selecting Data Sources - Experienced teachers carefully select data sources that will provide accurate and reliable information about student learning. This may include formal assessments, such as standardized tests, as well as informal assessments, such as observations and student self-assessments.\n\nStep 4: Analyzing and Interpreting Data - After collecting data from multiple sources, experienced teachers analyze and interpret the data to gain insights into student learning. This step involves using various techniques, such as graphing and statistical analysis, to identify patterns and trends in student performance.\n\nStep 5: Using Data to Adjust Instruction - Finally, experienced teachers use the data they have collected and analyzed to adjust their instruction and improve student learning. This may involve modifying teaching strategies, providing additional support to struggling students, or adjusting the learning goals and success criteria based on new information about student learning.\n\nBy following these five design steps, experienced teachers are able to create formative assessment plans that are aligned with their learning goals, driven by data, and flexible enough to accommodate adjustments and improvements as needed. These steps help ensure that the assessment plan is focused on measuring student learning and providing valuable feedback to both teachers and students."

Finally, the simulation environment often involves non-medical practitioners providing feedback, which can influence learners' credibility judgments. These differences have implications for formative assessment in the simulation environment, as learners must form credibility judgments about their educators and the feedback they receive in the absence of real patients and the pressures of clinical practice.

After removing duplicate publications and articles without authors or publication years, they were left with 898 publications.\n\nTheir search resulted in the discovery of 927 publications, which were then analyzed to determine the number of publications per year, citation information, and publication type. The authors found that there were various instances of book publishing each year, and they eliminated new publications based on citation information. They also studied the titles of the remaining publications to determine if there were any unrelated publications.\n\nOverall, the authors' search and analysis resulted in a comprehensive overview of online formative assessment in higher education, including the number of publications, citation information, and publication types."

Clarifying, sharing, and understanding learning intentions and criteria for success. This strategy involves teachers, students, and peers working together to establish clear learning objectives and assessment criteria. Examples include discussing rubrics with students, using exemplars to co-construct assessment criteria, and allowing students to formulate personal learning goals.\n2. Arranging effective classroom discussions, activities, and learning tasks that elicit insight into students' learning processes. This strategy involves the teacher initiating activities and discussions to gather information about students' understanding and to provide feedback. Examples include class discussions, quizzes, and other formative assessments.\n3. Providing effective teacher feedback that helps students determine where they are going next. Teacher feedback can take various forms, such as collective or individual, written or oral, and corrective or constructive feedback.\n4. Activating students as instructional resources for one another and as owners of their learning process through peer and self-assessment. Peer assessment involves students evaluating each other's work, while self-assessment involves students reflecting on their own learning. Both strategies can help students develop a sense of ownership over their learning and improve their self-regulation skills.\n5. Using these strategies collaboratively to create a learning environment that supports the development of all students. This strategy involves the teacher and students working together to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that fosters deep learning and understanding.\n\nIn summary, the five key strategies of formative assessment identified by Black and Wiliam (2009, 2018) are designed to provide a comprehensive approach to assessing student learning and promoting student achievement. By incorporating these strategies into their teaching practice, educators can create a dynamic and supportive learning environment that benefits all students."

However, there were limitations to these strategies. Specifically, Fredric did not describe or train the students on how to use formative assessment to support each other, nor did he allow them to practice self-regulation of their learning more broadly. As a result, formative assessment remained largely the responsibility of the teacher, and the adjustment cycles were often short due to the frequent implementation of tasks and the provision of feedback or adjusted instructional activities during the same or next lesson."

This includes considering the perspectives of learners, instructors, and administrators, as well as the broader cultural and institutional context. By taking an ecological approach, academics can better understand how their feedback practices fit into the larger landscape of learning and can tailor their approaches to promote effective feedback interactions that support the development of learners' professional identities.\n\nFor learners, the ecological model suggests that they are not passive recipients of feedback, but rather active participants in the feedback process. Learners should be encouraged to seek out feedback, evaluate its usefulness, and apply it in a deliberate and reflective manner. By doing so, learners can develop their own agency and self-regulation skills, which are essential for success in their professional formation. Additionally, the ecological model highlights the importance of considering the emotional legacy of feedback interactions on learners' developing professional identities."

The analysis is performed using a fixed effects method, which involves calculating a weighted mean effect size and a test for heterogeneity of effect sizes. The test for heterogeneity is based on the Q statistic, which has an approximate chi-square distribution with k-1 degrees of freedom, where k is the number of independent effect sizes. If the value of the Q statistic exceeds the critical chi-square value, it indicates that there is significant heterogeneity among the effect sizes, and the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effect sizes is rejected.\n\nThe result of this analysis is indicated by the value of the Q statistic and the I2 statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. If the Q statistic is statistically significant, it suggests that the effect sizes are heterogeneous, and the weighted average effect size may not be a reliable estimate of the population effect size. On the other hand, if the Q statistic is not statistically significant, it suggests that the effect sizes are homogeneous, and the weighted average effect size can be considered an estimate of the population effect size. The I2 statistic provides information about the proportion of variability in the effect sizes that is due to heterogeneity, and can be used to determine the degree of heterogeneity present in the data."

Feedback models categorized by informant groups, which involve feedback offered by teachers, peers, and the self. These models recognize that feedback can come from multiple sources and that each source may have a unique perspective on the learner's performance.\n3. Mixed feedback models, which combine elements of different feedback models to create a tailored approach to feedback.\n4. Specific feedback models, such as the 6P Feedback Model, which provides a structured approach to feedback by focusing on six key aspects of learning: purpose, progress, participation, performance, presentation, and partnership.\n\nEach of these feedback models has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice of which model to use will depend on the specific context and goals of the learning environment. Effective feedback models should be grounded in a deep understanding of the learning objectives and the needs of the learners, and should be designed to promote self-assessment and self-regulation skills."

This means that students should be able to monitor and evaluate their own learning over time, rather than relying solely on external evaluators. Additionally, sustainable assessment involves the use of assessment devices for student self-monitoring, which can help students to become more aware of their own learning processes and progress.\n\nAnother key aspect of sustainable assessment is the idea of \"constructive alignment,\" which refers to the integration of assessment tasks into the teaching and learning process itself (p. 2). This means that assessment is not seen as a separate entity, but rather as an integral part of the learning experience. Finally, sustainable assessment is also concerned with developing students' \"habits of mind\" and \"metacognitive skills\" (p. 326), such as the ability to approach problems from multiple perspectives and to work with complex issues. These skills are seen as essential for long-term learning and are closely tied to the development of sustainable assessment practices."

The observations were guided by an observation schema based on the \"big idea\" and the five key strategies of the professional development program. During the observed lessons, the researchers recorded and described the formative assessment activities in field notes.\n\nFor interviews, the researchers used a semi-structured interview guide with three parts. In the first part, the teachers were asked to describe their teaching practices after the professional development program without going into detail. The researchers then followed up with questions to prompt the teachers to provide more information about the changes they had made, such as \"What distinguishes your current teaching from the past?\" or \"How often would you say you do so?\" In the second part of the interview, the researchers asked the teachers to elaborate on the changes they had made for each of the five key strategies of the professional development program.

Similarly, Preskill and Catsambas (2006) used the 4-I model, which includes initiate, inquire, imagine, and innovate.\n\nType 2 uses AI principles but adds steps as suitable. Thibodeau (2011) divided education into four steps: start-up, assessment, building attachment, and viewing and understanding. The first step involves focusing on excellent experiences, prioritizing, searching for processes and cultural strengths, and identifying five or ten topics capable of making changes in the organization.\n\nType 3 combines the AI steps at every stage of education. For example, Andrus (2010) repeatedly applied all four AI phases through Phase 1 \u2013 \"Setting the Tone,\" Phase 2 \u2013 \"Building momentum and expanding the levels of change,\" and Phase 3 \u2013 \"Tolerance for change.\"\n\nEach type of appreciative inquiry has its own characteristics. Type 1 is more focused on discovering the strengths of the organization and using them to create positive change. Type 2 is more flexible and adaptive, allowing for the addition of new steps as needed. Type 3 is more comprehensive, covering all aspects of education and incorporating all four AI phases at every stage."

Increasing the frequency of formative assessment activities (third dimension): Fredric increased the frequency of formative assessment activities, such as using mini-whiteboards and exit passes, to gather information about each individual student's learning on a regular basis. This allowed him to adjust his instruction and provide feedback more frequently.\n4. Short adjustment cycles: Fredric's adjustment cycles were often short, with feedback or adjusted instructional activities following soon after the formative assessment activities. This allowed him to quickly identify areas where students were struggling and provide targeted support.\n\nOverall, Fredric's use of these strategies helped to create a classroom environment that was focused on formative assessment and continuous learning improvement. By encouraging collaboration, providing support, and regularly gathering information about student learning, Fredric was able to tailor his instruction to meet the needs of his students and promote their learning."

This includes manipulating equations, using mathematical models, and performing calculations. Teachers should monitor students' ability to accurately and efficiently apply mathematical techniques to solve problems.\n3. Transformation of context-bound solutions: After students have applied mathematical techniques to solve a problem, they need to transform their solutions back into physical terms to obtain meaningful results. This requires an understanding of the physical context of the problem and the ability to interpret the mathematical solutions in terms of that context. Teachers should monitor students' ability to make this transformation and communicate their solutions in a meaningful way.\n\nBy monitoring these three crucial episodes, teachers can help students develop flexible problem-solving skills in kinematics and ensure that they are able to apply mathematical techniques appropriately to solve real-world physics problems."

Competence: Providing help can help students develop their skills and knowledge, which can boost their confidence and motivation. When students receive feedback and guidance on how to improve, they are more likely to feel competent.\n3. Relatedness: Providing help can also contribute to students' feelings of relatedness by showing them that the teacher cares about their success. When students receive personalized attention and support, they may feel more connected to their peers and the teacher, which can foster a sense of belonging. Additionally, when students receive feedback that is specific, timely, and relevant, they are more likely to feel understood and valued, which can strengthen their sense of relatedness."

Effective feedback should be directed towards the instructional goal, rather than focusing on the student as a person. It should also be timely, allowing students to reflect on and use the feedback during the lesson. Additionally, feedback related to process and self-regulation is considered most helpful in advancing student learning, while limited task-oriented feedback may also be useful (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Finally, time is essential for both the provision of feedback and for students to make sense of and use the feedback (Cowie et al., 2013)."

For example, the teacher asks \"What do you think yourself?\" and later rephrases it as \"How do you think it went yourself?\" to prompt the student to evaluate their own performance.\n\nSecondly, the teacher uses hesitation markers such as \"e:\" and \"hva tenker du selv?\" to signal to the student that they are expecting a response and to give them time to think before answering. This creates a safe space for the student to express their thoughts and feelings without feeling pressured or judged.\n\nThirdly, the teacher uses a non-directive approach by allowing the student to provide their response at their own pace and not interrupting them. This is evident when the student takes a delay in responding and the teacher waits patiently for them to finish their thought.\n\nLastly, the teacher uses a confirmation strategy by providing an account of the student's presentation and framing it in a positive light. This encourages the student to agree with the teacher's assessment and provides them with an opportunity to expand on their thoughts and feelings. Overall, the teacher's use of these techniques creates a supportive and inclusive learning environment that fosters self-assessment and reflection."

      "content": "In the classroom/academic microsystem, medical students learn through a variety of activities, including peer and tutor feedback, written and verbal communication, and formal summative assessment (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). However, research suggests that medical students often view feedback as a one-way process, which can limit the potential benefits of feedback (Murdoch-Eaton & Sargeant, 2012; Urquhart et al., 2014). To address this challenge, educators could aim to create an active and collaborative learning environment where feedback is viewed as a mutual and iterative process, rather than a one-way transmission of information. This could involve encouraging students to ask questions, share their own perspectives, and engage in dialogue with their peers and educators. Additionally, incorporating technology-enhanced feedback methods, such as video analysis and self-assessment tools, may help to enhance the effectiveness of feedback in this setting."

Teachers can also use formative assessments to inform their instruction and adjust their teaching strategies based on the needs of their students. Additionally, incorporating technology and student-selected materials into the curriculum can help to increase student interest and motivation.\n\nTo establish a positive learning environment, teachers should begin lessons with thought-provoking activities or questions that reflect student interest or activate prior knowledge. This helps to capture student interest and engage them in the learning process. Teachers should also communicate with their students in a positive and respectful manner, using both verbal and non-verbal cues to reinforce desired behaviors and attitudes.\n\nAnother key strategy for creating a positive learning environment is to establish a consistent set of classroom rules and procedures, and to communicate these clearly to students. This helps to create a sense of order and structure in the classroom, which can promote a sense of safety and security for students. Additionally, teachers can use formative assessments to monitor student progress and adjust their instruction accordingly. By regularly checking in with students and providing feedback, teachers can help to build confidence and motivation among their students.\n\nFinally, incorporating technology and student-selected materials into the curriculum can help to increase student interest and motivation. When students have a say in what they learn and how they learn it, they are more likely to be engaged in the learning process. This can also help to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among students, which can lead to increased academic achievement.\n\nOverall, creating a positive learning environment is essential for promoting student engagement and academic achievement. By using effective strategies such as establishing clear classroom rules and procedures, using positive communication, incorporating technology and student-selected materials, and regularly monitoring student progress, teachers can create a supportive and inclusive learning environment that benefits all students."

Teachers who receive sufficient training on formative assessment are more likely to have better practices in the classroom, leading to improved student performance (Fuller & Dawson, 2017). Collaborative dialogue and social interaction between teachers and students, as well as among students, are crucial for cognitive skill development (Vygotsky, cited in S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 2015). To overcome challenges such as time constraints, large class sizes, and curriculum pressures, formative activities should be designed with metacognition in mind, encouraging students to reflect on their own learning processes. Additionally, regular checks on teachers' practices against the formative assessment concept can help ensure successful implementation. According to Dewey (S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 2015), learning activities should grow out of learners' existing knowledge and experience, and formative assessment should be seen as a means of raising teachers' awareness of the effective use of learning evidence to improve student performance."

      "content": "There are several strategies that teachers can use to communicate clear expectations to students and support their self-efficacy beliefs through formative assessment. Firstly, teachers can explicitly communicate expectations using explicit language and provide examples of what constitutes successful performance. This can help students understand what is expected of them and reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes due to unclear expectations. Secondly, teachers can involve students in defining assessment criteria, such as through student training, the use of exemplars, and co-construction of rubrics. This can help students understand the criteria better and feel a sense of ownership over the assessment process. Additionally, providing feedback that contains information on the learning goals, actual task performance, and how to proceed can contribute to students' feelings of competence and self-efficacy. Finally, formative assessment can provide students with clues for attribution, such as why they failed or succeeded, and which role they played in the outcome. Teachers can use this information to support students' self-efficacy beliefs and communicate their expectations explicitly.\n\nMike is seen to provide more translations than Dave in response to the outcomes of the quizzes, which helps to support students' self-efficacy beliefs. Additionally, Mike's use of instant feedback on the digital formative language test provides students with information about the cause of their failure, which can help them to understand their strengths and weaknesses better. Overall, effective communication of expectations and support for self-efficacy beliefs through formative assessment can have a positive impact on students' motivation and learning outcomes."

Alignment: Experienced teachers ensure that their formative assessment plans are aligned with the learning objectives and standards of the course. They do this by carefully reviewing the curriculum and ensuring that their assessments are designed to measure the skills and knowledge that students are expected to acquire. For instance, they may use backward design, starting with the desired results and working backwards to create assessments that are aligned with the learning objectives.\n2. Decision-driven data collection: Experienced teachers collect data from their formative assessments in a deliberate and purposeful manner. They use this data to inform their instruction and make decisions about student learning. For example, they may use formative assessment data to identify areas where students are struggling and then adjust their teaching to address those areas.\n3. Room for adjustment and improvement: Experienced teachers recognize that formative assessment is an ongoing process and that there is always room for adjustment and improvement. They continually reflect on their assessments and make changes as needed to ensure that they are effective in measuring student learning. For instance, they may use feedback from students and colleagues to refine their assessments and improve their effectiveness over time.\n\nIn summary, experienced teachers contribute to meeting the three criteria of alignment, decision-driven data collection, and room for adjustment and improvement through their careful planning, deliberate data collection, and continuous reflection and improvement. By doing so, they ensure that their formative assessments are effective in measuring student learning and promoting student achievement."

Written suggestions: Helen provided written suggestions to students to support their autonomy and self-regulation. For example, when students were stuck on a task or did not understand something, they were given written suggestions on what to do next.\n5. Time management: Helen encouraged students to monitor and manage their own time during lessons. Students set goals for how many minutes of a lesson should be spent on focused learning, and they were expected to track their progress towards these goals.\n6. Self-directed learning: Helen provided opportunities for students to take ownership of their own learning by setting their own learning goals, assessing their own progress, and seeking help when needed. This helped students develop their ability to self-regulate their own learning.\n\nOverall, Helen's approach to teaching was centered around supporting students' self-regulation of learning through a variety of strategies that encouraged active engagement, peer support, and self-assessment.

Finally, in 2021-01, an increase was observed due to the hiring of new teachers, but they had to adapt to the remote teaching methodology due to the pandemic. The individual data analysis revealed that although there were teachers with an evaluation below 4.0 in all dimensions, teachers had a global teaching performance evaluation equal to or greater than 4.0 with at least one dimension below, generating an early warning to accompany the teacher and reduce the possibility that their teacher performance evaluation falls below 4.0."

To achieve this, researchers can use various methods such as video clips of classroom sessions, effective discussions, and virtual reality technology. Additionally, it is important to give students sufficient time to digest the results of formative assessments, as this is a crucial step for their learning process.\n\nMoreover, the assessments should be designed to comprehensively evaluate and improve students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes in complex problem-solving situations. This can be achieved by considering the specific design of formative assessments, such as the use of open-ended questions, performance tasks, and self-assessment strategies. Furthermore, the assessments should be tailored to the needs of individual students, taking into account their prior knowledge, learning styles, and cultural backgrounds.\n\nFinally, it is essential to consider the role of teachers' metacognitive abilities, knowledge base, effective classroom management, and diverse teaching methods in the design and implementation of formative assessments. By doing so, educators can ensure that the assessments are aligned with the learning objectives and are effective in promoting deep learning and understanding."

This can be achieved by creating a learning environment that fosters engagement and provides opportunities for students to develop their skills and understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, instructors should consider the impact of their expectations and the language they use on students' dispositions, as negative messages can undermine efforts to promote engagement and appropriate dispositions.\n\nInstructors should also consider the use of explicit criteria and standards in assessment tasks, as well as the potential for holistic judgments. Providing clear criteria can help students understand how their work will be evaluated, but it may also create a false sense of security if markers do not actually use these criteria. Moreover, involving peers in the judgment process, either formally or informally, can provide additional perspectives and feedback for students.\n\nFinally, instructors should ensure that assessment tasks are meaningful and engaging for students, and that they provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and skills in a practical context.

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The use of scoring rubrics in student learning can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. On the one hand, rubrics can help students understand and use feedback from teachers, peers, and themselves, leading to increased learning-oriented self-regulation (SRL) and improved performance. Rubrics can also provide transparency and clear criteria, allowing students to better plan, monitor, and evaluate their work, which can reduce anxiety and negative SRL strategies. Additionally, the use of rubrics can lead to a decrease in performance- and avoidance-oriented SRL strategies, as students become more focused on learning rather than avoiding failure.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of rubrics can also lead to an increase in stress and performance orientation, as students may feel pressure to meet the explicit criteria and receive high scores. This can result in an unfortunate situation where \"criteria compliance\" replaces productive learning, as described by Torrance (2007). Moreover, the use of rubrics may not necessarily increase learning-oriented SRL, as some studies have found that students who use rubrics report higher levels of stress and lower levels of engagement. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of using scoring rubrics in student learning, and to implement them in a way that promotes productive learning and minimizes negative effects."

The author argues that sustainable assessment can help teachers and students develop a deeper understanding of learning and improve their ability to self-assess and self-regulate. However, the author also acknowledges that the potential of sustainable assessment is yet to be fully realized and that progress has been slow.\n\nThe author identifies several key directions for realizing the potential of sustainable assessment. Firstly, they suggest that assessment must be repositioned as an integral part of curriculum and pedagogy, rather than a separate entity. This requires a shift away from high-stakes testing and towards more authentic and meaningful forms of assessment. Secondly, the author emphasizes the importance of developing informed judgment in both teachers and students, which can be achieved through the use of self and peer assessment. Finally, the author highlights the need for ongoing professional development for teachers to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to implement sustainable assessment practices effectively.\n\nOverall, the author's perspective is that sustainable assessment has the potential to transform education by promoting deep learning and self-regulation, but that realizing this potential will require significant changes in how assessment is approached and implemented in schools and universities."

For example, a teacher might use AI to facilitate a class discussion about a successful group project, asking students to share their contributions to the project and how they felt about their participation. This type of exercise can help students develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self-confidence, as well as foster a sense of community and collaboration among students. Additionally, AI can be used to help students set goals for themselves, identify resources and strategies for achieving those goals, and track their progress over time. By incorporating AI into classroom assessment and self-development activities, teachers can provide students with a powerful tool for promoting self-knowing and self-development."

      "content": "The 4C/ID model of instructional design is a theoretical framework that was introduced in 2002 by Van-Merri\u00ebnboer and Kester. It is designed to support the learning of complex skills by breaking down the learning process into four components: component-based learning, cognitive schema development, rule automation, and scaffolding.\n\nComponent-based learning involves the decomposition of complex skills into smaller, more manageable components. This allows learners to focus on mastering each component before moving on to more challenging tasks. Cognitive schema development involves the creation of mental models or frameworks that help learners organize and make sense of the information they are learning. Rule automation refers to the process of internalizing the rules and procedures associated with a particular skill, making them more automatic and easier to recall. Scaffolding involves the provision of supportive information, procedural information, and part-task practice to help learners navigate the learning process.\n\nThe 4C/ID model is based on the idea that complex skills are composed of smaller, more manageable components, and that learners must invest sufficient effort into the construction of cognitive schema and the automation of cognitive processes in order to master these skills. By using the 4C/ID model, instructors can create instructional designs that are tailored to the needs of their learners, and that support the development of complex skills in a gradual and systematic way.\n\nResearch has shown that the 4C/ID model is effective in supporting the learning of complex skills, particularly in the fields of mathematics, science, and vocational education. Studies have found that the use of the 4C/ID model can improve learner outcomes, such as academic performance and skill transfer, and can help learners develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter."

These accounts addressed external factors that had influenced their preparation and served to prevent potential negative assessment from the teacher. For instance, one student explained that they had been ill before the presentation, while another mentioned that they were nervous during the presentation. By providing these accounts, the students were able to contextualize their performance and justify their self-assessments.\n\nSecondly, the students oriented to the teachers' third position prompt for elaboration as a place to provide an account, rather than offering further assessments. When the teachers pursued elaborations with a \"yes?\" in third position, the students produced accounts rather than providing further assessments. This suggests that the students viewed the third position prompt as an opportunity to provide a contextualizing account, rather than an invitation for further assessment.\n\nFinally, the students used the opportunity to contextualize their performance and address external factors that had influenced their preparation. They did not focus on their presentation skills or content, but instead emphasized external factors that had affected their ability to prepare or perform well.

One challenge is that many assessment conventions were created for a different era and may not align with the new framework, leading to the specification of learning outcomes that may not fully represent what is desired (Deneen & Boud, 2014). Additionally, the marking process may be heavily influenced by tradition, making it difficult to implement change (ibid.). Another challenge is the lack of scalability in hard-copy learning portfolios, which can limit their use for whole programs (Clarke & Boud, submitted for publication).\n\nTo address these challenges, one approach is to focus on the development of robust learning outcomes in the first and second iterations, as these outcomes tend to be more effective in subsequent iterations (Deneen & Boud, 2014). Additionally, institutions can work to improve the alignment of assessment processes with the new framework, such as by using electronic portfolios that provide digital affordances for the purposes of assessment (Clarke & Boud, submitted for publication). Finally, institutions can consider the use of learning portfolios for whole programs, as these can provide a more comprehensive view of student learning and facilitate the aggregation of results in a more educationally justifiable manner (ibid.). By addressing these challenges, institutions can implement a standards-based or outcome-oriented assessment framework that is more effective and equitable for all students."

Firstly, the assessment must be used frequently to influence students' own self-assessment, as noted by Boud (1995b). This frequent assessment helps to enhance student achievement and should be done in a way that encourages reflective assessment with peers. Peer assessment can be effective when students learn from each other, but it is important to avoid using peers as surrogate assessors for summative assessment purposes. Instead, the focus should be on creating a climate where students can give and receive feedback as part of the learning process.\n\nTo ensure that formative assessment is effective, students must also have the opportunity to use feedback to improve their work. This means that they should be given multiple chances to complete the feedback loop, allowing them to gain confidence in their abilities and demonstrate desired outcomes. Finally, finding a balance between providing new learning opportunities and enabling students to complete the feedback loop is crucial. This allows students to benefit from both the new learning experiences and the feedback they receive, leading to maximized learning outcomes."

Technological Knowledge: This includes sufficient broad knowledge of technological tools to use them in everyday life. Teachers need to be familiar with a range of technologies that can support teaching and learning, such as multimedia presentation software, online collaboration tools, and educational apps.\n\nThe TPACK framework recognizes that these three types of knowledge intersect and inform one another. For example, technological pedagogical knowledge requires teachers to understand how to best incorporate technological tools into classrooms for the purpose of enhancing student learning.

They used an observation schema based on the framework comprising the \"big idea\" and the five key strategies to structure the observations. During the observed lessons, the researchers recorded and described the identified formative assessment activities in field notes.\n2. Semi-structured interviews: The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with the teachers after the observations. The interviews were directed by an interview guide and lasted approximately 1.5 hours. The interview guide had three parts:\n\t* Part 1: The teachers were asked to describe their teaching after the PDP without going into detail. Follow-up questions were used to prompt the teachers to provide more information about the changes they made.\n\t* Part 2: The researchers asked the teachers to elaborate on the changes made for each of the five key strategies. They followed up with questions related to each strategy after the teacher had mentioned changes in that area.\n\t* Part 3: The researchers asked the teachers about their experiences of implementing the PDP and the reasons behind their specific instructional decisions.\n\nOverall, the researchers used both observational and interview data to collect information on the teachers' classroom practices and beliefs after participating in the PDP."

Medium-term goals: Summative assessment is concerned with assessing student learning in relation to medium-term goals, such as those set for the end of a year, semester, or stage of education.\n3. Multiple methods of evidence collection: Summative assessment can involve a range of methods for collecting evidence of student learning, including tests, exams, observations, portfolios, and computer-based tasks.\n4. High stakes: Summative assessment can have high stakes, as the results may be used for evaluative judgments that affect student selection, school reputation, and funding.\n\nWhen choosing methods for collecting evidence for summative assessment, several considerations should be taken into account, including:\n\n1. Validity: The assessment methods should measure what they are intended to measure, and should not be influenced by factors that are unrelated to the learning objectives.\n2. Reliability: The assessment methods should produce consistent results, and should not be subject to variability due to factors such as test administrator bias or inconsistent scoring.\n3. Practicality: The assessment methods should be feasible to administer and score, and should not require excessive resources or time.\n4. Fairness: The assessment methods should be fair and unbiased, and should not disadvantage certain groups of students, such as those with disabilities or those from diverse backgrounds.\n5. Purpose: The assessment methods should be aligned with the purpose of the assessment, and should provide useful information for evaluating student learning and making informed decisions about student progress."

      "content": "To elicit self-evaluations from students in a debriefing conversation after a simulation-based activity, one strategy is to ask negatively tilted questions that encourage students to reflect on what they could have done differently. For example, the facilitator might ask, \"What would you have done differently?\" or \"What do you wish you had done differently?\" This type of question directs the student's attention to their own performance and encourages them to evaluate it critically. Additionally, the facilitator can use nonverbal cues such as gazing at a specific student to direct the question to them and create a sense of individual accountability. It is important to frame the evaluation as an observation that anyone can make, rather than restricting it to the student's personal judgment. By using this approach, the facilitator can help students develop a more objective perspective on their own performance and identify areas for improvement."

Additionally, there may be cultural and linguistic barriers that affect the way students respond to assessments, and the pressure to achieve high grades can create stress and impact student well-being.\n\nTo address these challenges, teachers could consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers should be aware of the cultural backgrounds of their students and adapt their teaching methods accordingly. This can involve using authentic materials and examples that reflect the students' cultures, and incorporating diverse perspectives into the curriculum.\n2. Clear communication: Teachers should clearly communicate the formative or summative status of assessments to students, and provide explicit criteria for success. This can help students understand the purpose of the assessment and how it contributes to their learning.\n3. Flexible assessment designs: Teachers should consider using a variety of assessment formats and tasks that allow students to demonstrate their learning in different ways. This can help to reduce the pressure to achieve high grades and encourage more experimental and open learning behaviors.\n4. Collaboration with students: Teachers should work with students to co-create learning goals and assessment criteria, and involve them in the assessment process as much as possible. This can help to increase student engagement and agency, and promote a growth mindset.\n5. Professional development: Teachers should engage in ongoing professional development to learn about effective formative assessment practices and how to implement them in their classrooms. This can help to build their capacity to design and implement assessments that support student learning.\n\nBy addressing these challenges and incorporating effective formative assessment practices, teachers can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that promotes student engagement, motivation, and achievement."

One challenge was the cultural norms and expectations of her students, who were accustomed to a culture of right and wrong and competition among students rather than learning for its intrinsic value. This made it difficult for Phoebe to help her students break free from these traditional norms and strive for understanding. Another challenge was the demanding pace of the curriculum, which left little time for reflection and revision. Additionally, Phoebe struggled to balance the need for formative assessment with the high-stakes testing requirements of her school. To address these challenges, Phoebe relied on her theoretical and strategic knowledge of teaching and learning to inform her decisions about how to structure her classes and design formative assessment activities. She also worked to create a supportive classroom environment that encouraged collaboration and peer interaction, and she sought out professional development opportunities to stay up-to-date with new developments in education. Finally, she continuously reflected on her practice and made adjustments as needed to ensure that her formative assessment strategies were effective in promoting student learning."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Formative assessment and summative assessment are two distinct types of assessment used in pedagogy to evaluate student learning. Formative assessment is a process of evaluating student progress during the learning process, with the primary goal of improving student learning outcomes. It is a continuous and ongoing process that provides feedback to both teachers and students, enabling them to adjust their teaching and learning strategies accordingly. In contrast, summative assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of student learning at the end of a lesson, unit, or course. Its primary purpose is to evaluate student achievement and assign grades based on their performance.\n\nHowever, assessment cannot be understood in isolation from the wider context within which it takes place. Teachers and schools are influenced by cultural traditions, political and public expectations, and norms of the various institutions in which they operate. These factors can impact the type of assessment used, the methods employed, and the criteria for evaluation. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the wider context when designing and implementing assessments to ensure they are valid, reliable, and meaningful.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between formative and summative assessment is complex. While formative assessment focuses on providing feedback to improve student learning, summative assessment provides a final evaluation of student achievement. However, the distinctions between these two types of assessment are not always clear-cut, and they can overlap in practice. For instance, a formative assessment task can also serve as a summative assessment if it is used to evaluate student learning at the end of a lesson or unit. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the purposes and goals of assessment tasks to ensure they align with the needs of students and teachers.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the differences between formative and summative assessment and considering the wider context within which assessment takes place are essential for effective teaching and learning. By using a combination of formative and summative assessments, teachers can provide ongoing feedback to students, evaluate their progress, and make adjustments to their teaching strategies to improve student learning outcomes."

Alignment: The first step is to align the formative assessment plan with the learning goals and objectives of the lesson or unit. Teachers should ensure that the assessment tasks and activities are directly related to the skills and knowledge being taught.\n2. Decision-Driven Data Collection: The second step is to determine which data points are most important for informing instruction and making decisions about student learning. Teachers should choose assessment tasks that provide relevant and reliable data that can be used to make informed decisions.\n3. Room for Adjustment and Improvement: The third step is to built in opportunities for adjustment and improvement throughout the lesson or unit. Teachers should regularly review the assessment data and make adjustments to instruction as needed to ensure that students are meeting the learning goals.\n\nTo further ensure that their plans meet these criteria, teachers can also engage in semi-structured interviews with experienced teachers to gain deeper insights into the design process and potential pitfalls to avoid. By following these steps and incorporating the input of experienced teachers, teachers can create effective formative assessment plans that support student learning and achievement."

These events featured panels of experts, including the originators of case examples and student representatives, who discussed issues raised in the briefings.\n\nThe digital videos included a \"vox pop\" on feedback from the perspective of HKU students, featuring 20 students sharing their experiences of receiving feedback on assignments and assessments. This was intended as a stimulus for discussion among teaching colleagues, departments, or teachers and their classes. Additionally, there were \"talking heads\" videos, short, edited recordings of interviews with prominent scholars on their insights into assessment for learning. These videos aimed to communicate the scholars' insights succinctly and accessibly, linked to their fuller published work for further exploration.\n\nOverall, the purpose of these outputs was to provide a range of bridging tools that offered community participants a choice of modes and levels of engagement, recognizing the diverse needs and interests of colleagues in terms of their teaching, research, and service commitments.

The template allows for the creation of various types of exercises, such as quizzes, numerical exercises, multiple-choice questions, open-ended questions, fill-in-the-blanks questions, and coding evaluation. The template also randomizes the parameters of the exercises, ensuring that each student receives a unique set of exercises tailored to their needs. This approach allows for effective assessment and evaluation of individual students, while also streamlining the grading process for instructors. Additionally, the use of a generic LaTeX template ensures consistency and fairness in the evaluation process, as all students receive the same type and number of exercises, with the parameters randomly selected from a predefined collection."

This includes the ability to choose the topics they want to learn about, the methods they use to learn, and the pace at which they proceed.\n\nCompetence refers to the need for students to feel effective and capable in their learning activities. This includes the need for feedback, opportunities to practice and improve their skills, and a sense of mastery over the material.\n\nRelatedness refers to the need for students to feel a sense of connection and belonging to their peers and teachers. This includes the need for positive relationships, social support, and a sense of community in the classroom.\n\nWhen these three needs are met, students are more likely to experience autonomous motivation, which is associated with higher levels of achievement, persistence, and well-being."

The author also emphasizes the importance of using specific, outcome-specific grade descriptors to communicate the standards for a particular course or program.\n\nThe author bases their argument on the fact that essays, for example, cannot be marked to percentage level accuracy, and that even if a test has 100 items, the results cannot be meaningfully reported to percentage accuracy. Instead, the author suggests that the traditional Australian university classification of Pass, Credit, Distinction, and Higher Distinction is probably the maximum level of granularity that can be accurately judged. The author also notes that using terms like \"good,\" \"superior,\" and \"excellent\" does not communicate a standard or specify what is required for a particular grade.\n\nIn summary, the author's argument is that the reporting of student achievement should be limited to a level of granularity that is consistent with the level of accuracy that can be judged, and that specific, outcome-specific grade descriptors should be used to communicate the standards for a particular course or program."

They also discuss any differences in their appreciation of the quality of the plans and identify potential pitfalls in the plans that did not meet the criteria.\n\nNext, they use semi-structured interviews to gather insights into the design process of experienced teachers. These interviews focus on the teachers' design process, including the steps they took to design the plan, any difficulties they encountered, and how they resolved them. The conversation then turns to comparing the design steps to the design story shared by the teacher, highlighting areas where the teacher followed the five design steps and where their process differed.\n\nIn particular, the teachers are asked about their choices in step 2 of the design process regarding when and why they planned checkpoints, what they chose to do at each checkpoint to elicit information about student learning, and whether they had linked checkpoints together. By taking these steps, experienced teachers are able to design effective formative assessment plans that meet the three quality criteria and support student learning."

      "content": "To assess student learning in a way that mirrors real-life uses of the discipline, instructors can incorporate authentic tasks and real-world examples into their assessments. This can include asking students to create a portfolio of their work, like a professional architect would, or assigning fieldwork reports based on real-world scenarios, like a history student visiting a museum. Additionally, instructors can use iterative processes, such as presenting designs publicly for critical review and receiving feedback before revising, to mimic the way professionals in the field operate.\n\nPotential benefits of using these strategies include increased student engagement and motivation, as well as improved preparation for future careers. Students may find the assessments more meaningful and relevant to their lives, leading to higher levels of participation and performance. Moreover, these strategies can help students develop skills that are directly applicable to their future careers, such as problem-solving, communication, and collaboration.\n\nHowever, there are also potential challenges to consider. Some students may struggle with the more open-ended and authentic nature of these assessments, especially if they are not accustomed to this type of learning. Additionally, instructors may need to invest more time and effort into designing and implementing these assessments, and there may be concerns about fairness and equity if some students have more experience or resources than others. Finally, there may be logistical challenges to incorporating real-world examples and authentic tasks into assessments, such as securing fieldwork locations or obtaining permission to use copyrighted materials."

By doing so, teacher candidates can gain insights into the knowledge their students draw upon to make sense of observed phenomena.\n\nSecondly, teacher candidates can use reflective discussions to support their ability to see students' ideas as productive and valuable, even if they do not originate in the classroom. This involves encouraging students to share their thoughts and experiences, listening attentively to their responses, and providing feedback that values and builds upon their ideas.\n\nThirdly, teacher candidates can design assignments that encourage students to leverage their funds of knowledge in science investigations. For instance, they can ask students to conduct research projects that incorporate their personal interests and experiences, or to create multimedia presentations that showcase their understanding of scientific concepts using their preferred modes of expression.\n\nFinally, teacher candidates can model the practice of leveraging funds of knowledge by sharing their own experiences and sources of knowledge with their students. This can help to create a classroom environment where diverse perspectives and ways of knowing are valued and encouraged. By implementing these strategies, teacher candidates can become more effective in eliciting and responding to students' funds of knowledge in science investigations, leading to a more inclusive and productive learning environment."

This has led to a host of initiatives designed to tackle the perceived problems, such as focusing on feedback turnaround times and developing student understanding of quality and self-regulated learning. Additionally, the scaling up of attention to the assessment and feedback element of the AfL (Assessment for Learning) agenda has been driven by the expansion of research and development interests in this area over the past 15 years, as evidenced by the growing number of articles published in academic journals. Finally, the institutional commitment to REAP (Re-engineering Assessment Practices) principles and the introduction of feedback awards have also contributed to the scaling up of good practices in assessment and feedback."

Authentic tasks: Assignments that reflect real-world scenarios and require students to apply their knowledge and skills in a meaningful way. These tasks can provide valuable formative feedback to students while also serving as a summative assessment of their learning.\n2. Rubrics: Detailed criteria for evaluating student performance that can guide both formative and summative assessment. Rubrics can help instructors provide constructive feedback to students during the learning process, while also providing a clear and transparent evaluation framework for summative assessment.\n3. Self-assessment opportunities: Encourage students to engage in self-assessment by providing them with regular opportunities to reflect on their own learning and set goals for improvement. This can help students develop metacognitive skills and take ownership of their learning, while also informing summative assessment.\n4. Flexibility: Design assessments that can be adapted to meet the needs of different learners and learning contexts. This can include allowing students to choose from a range of assessment options or providing alternative assessment pathways for students with diverse learning needs.\n5. Feedback loops: Build feedback loops into the assessment process to ensure that students receive timely and targeted feedback on their performance. This can involve providing formative feedback during the learning process and using summative assessment results to refine instruction and improve student learning."

The first dimension consists of three key processes in teaching, learning, and formative assessment: establishing where the learners are going in their learning, establishing where the learners are right now in their learning, and establishing what needs to be done to get where they are going. These processes constitute the de\ufb01ning characteristics of formative assessment inherent in the de\ufb01nition above.\n\nThe five key strategies for formative assessment identified by Wiliam and Thompson (2008) are related to these key processes in the following ways:\n\n1. Clarifying, sharing, and understanding learning intentions and the criteria for success helps establish where the learners are going in their learning.\n2. Engineering effective classroom discussions, questions, and tasks that elicit evidence of learning helps establish where the learners are right now in their learning.\n3. Providing feedback that moves learners forward helps establish what needs to be done to get where they are going.\n4. Activating students as instructional resources for one another and activating students as the owners of their own learning help to engage students in the learning process and take ownership of their own learning.\n\nOverall, the key strategies for formative assessment identified by Wiliam and Thompson (2008) are designed to support the de\ufb01ning characteristics of formative assessment by helping teachers use evidence of student learning to adjust instruction to better meet the identified student learning needs."

They interviewed each participant three times over the course of the study using a semi-structured interview protocol.\n\nTo observe the participants' formative assessment practices, the researchers used the Candidate Preservice Assessment of Student Teaching (CPAST), which is a formative and summative evaluation tool that measures teacher candidates' pedagogical knowledge/skills and professional dispositions during the student teaching practicum. The CPAST is a valid and reliable observation tool, and the teacher participants were familiar with its structure as they had previously used it during their clinical experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the researchers administered a teacher effectiveness survey at the beginning and end of the study, basing questions on the Silver Strong teacher effectiveness framework. The survey asked participants to self-assess their effectiveness for various indicators on a 1-4 rating scale.\n\nFinally, the researchers collected de-identified assessment data from all teacher participants, including universal screening data (e.g., state reading assessment, i-Ready, easyCBM) and teacher-created classroom assessments (e.g., quizzes, homework, exit tickets, worksheets, journal entries, Seesaw activities, Google Surveys, Google Doc assignments)."

For studies that reported data for multiple classrooms or different non-overlapping demographics, the researchers treated these studies as statistically independent, despite the potential lack of independence due to data collection and analysis stemming from the use of a single research team.\n2. If outcome measures were provided for multiple groups of subjects, where the groups were ordered in terms of the quality and frequency of formative assessment practices, the researchers used the difference between the highest and lowest groups as the effect size.\n3. Each effect size was weighted using the inverse of the sampling error variance for mean difference - unstandardized (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001, p. 72).\n4. A standard error was also calculated for each effect size statistic.\n5. In cases where the studies reported mean standard deviations on the dependent variable across groups rather than independent standard deviations for each group, the researchers used the mean standard deviation as a nonbiased estimator of each group's standard deviation.\n\nOverall, the researchers used a careful and thoughtful approach to calculating effect sizes in order to quantify the strength of the relationship between formative assessment strategies and student achievement."

The author emphasizes the personal and societal implications of assessment, highlighting its influence on our learning, identity, and the construction of society. To implement sustainable assessment practices, educators must consider the long-term effects of their methods and prioritize the development of students' skills and abilities over mere content mastery.\n\nIn practice, this could involve incorporating regular, formative assessments throughout the learning process, providing feedback that is constructive and actionable, and using technology to facilitate self-assessment and peer review. Additionally, educators might consider involving students in the design and implementation of assessments, fostering a collaborative and inclusive approach to learning and evaluation. By adopting these strategies, educators can help students develop into lifelong learners who are equipped to navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing world."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Formative assessments can be designed to increase metacognitive awareness among students by incorporating diagnostic cues that signal the cognitive demands of the course and the importance of specific skills and strategies. Comprehension cues, such as the amount of information recognized when reading a question or discussing it with peers, can help students understand the knowledge and quality of cognitive states required for successful learning. Course demands cues, such as the type of questions posed, the level of abstraction, and the difficulty of the questions, can inform students of the most important course content and the significance of these questions in summative assessments. Additionally, prompts in formative assessments can help students recognize the relevance of the course content to real-world situations and apply metacognitive skills.\n\nTo implement these diagnostic cues effectively, it is important to consider the timing of formative assessments and ensure that they are not given immediately after learning new course content. A delay between the learning activity and the formative assessment can make comprehension cues less diagnostic of learning. Moreover, repetition of certain questions and the teacher's emphasis on solution strategies can also inform students of the most important course content and the significance of these questions in summative assessments. By incorporating these design elements into formative assessments, teachers can help students develop metacognitive awareness and improve their learning outcomes."

In contrast, formative evaluation is defined as the evaluation of assessment-based evidence for the purpose of providing feedback to and informing teachers, students, and educational stakeholders about the teaching and learning process. Formative evaluation also informs policy, which can then affect future evaluation practices, teachers, and students.\n\nThe authors emphasize that formative evaluation is not just a preliminary step towards summative evaluation, but rather a crucial aspect of the teaching and learning process that can improve student performance and inform instructional decision-making. They argue that the two types of evaluation are not mutually exclusive, and that effective implementation of formative evaluation can lead to improved student outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the authors' key argument is that formative and summative evaluation are not distinct entities, but rather two ends of a continuum of assessment practices that are closely intertwined and influence one another. By recognizing this relationship and distinguishing between the two types of evaluation based on their intended uses, the authors hope to provide a clearer understanding of the role of assessment in the teaching and learning process."

      "content": "A comprehensive model for pedagogy and instruction includes several key components that are designed to work together in a cyclical process. These components include:\n\n1. Educational purposes: The first component involves determining what educational purposes the school should seek to attain. This includes identifying the knowledge, skills, and values that students should acquire through their education.\n2. Educational experiences: The second component involves providing educational experiences that are likely to attain the desired purposes. This includes selecting appropriate teaching methods, materials, and assessments that align with the educational purposes.\n3. Organization of educational experiences: The third component involves organizing the educational experiences in a way that supports the achievement of the educational purposes. This includes deciding on the sequence of learning activities, the length of the learning activities, and the timing of assessments.\n4. Review of learning: The fourth component involves regularly reviewing the learning progress of students to ensure that the educational purposes are being attained. This includes using both formative and summative assessments to evaluate student learning and make adjustments to the instruction as needed.\n5. External summative assessment: The fifth component involves using external summative assessments to evaluate student learning at the end of a course or program. This provides an independent evaluation of student learning and helps to ensure that the educational purposes have been attained.\n\nThe components of the model interrelate in a cyclical process, with each component influencing the others. For example, the results of a review of learning may lead to changes in the organization of educational experiences, which in turn may affect the educational purposes. Similarly, the results of external summative assessments may influence the educational purposes and the selection of educational experiences. By considering all of these components in a comprehensive model, educators can create a coherent and effective approach to pedagogy and instruction."

      "content": "Effective formative assessment in EFL classrooms requires a combination of teacher training, collaboration, and metacognitive activation. Teachers who receive sufficient training on formative assessment are more likely to have better practices in the classroom, leading to improved student performance (Fuller & Dawson, 2017). Collaborative dialogue and social interaction between teachers and students, as well as among students, are crucial for cognitive skill development (Vygotsky, cited in S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 2015). To overcome challenges such as time constraints, large class sizes, and curriculum pressures, formative activities should be designed with metacognition in mind, encouraging students to reflect on their own learning processes. Additionally, regular checks on teachers' practices against the formative assessment concept can help ensure successful implementation. According to Dewey (S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 2015), learning activities should grow out of learners' existing knowledge and experience, and formative assessment should be seen as a means of raising teachers' awareness of the effective use of learning evidence to improve student performance."

Firstly, starting from existing and consciously planned series of lessons helps teachers ensure alignment between learning objectives, lesson activities, and assessment. Secondly, taking time to understand learning objectives helps teachers identify the information they need to collect to inform their formative decisions. Thirdly, using existing lesson activities to elicit evidence of student learning instead of designing new ones helps teachers save time and reduce the likelihood of incomplete or unclear plans. Fourthly, precisely measuring what they need to know to inform their formative decisions helps teachers ensure decision-driven data collection. Fifthly, combining various sources of information about all students' learning helps teachers gain a comprehensive understanding of their students' progress. Sixthly, preparing different follow-ups to match different possible outcomes from formative assessment helps teachers tailor their instruction to individual students' needs. Finally, purposely creating time and space for improvement and adjustment in the curriculum helps teachers continuously refine their formative assessment plans. By incorporating these strategies into their design process, experienced teachers can increase the effectiveness of their formative assessment plans and improve student learning outcomes."

Building shared understandings of assessment and feedback between academics and students through clarifying expectations and developing trust.\n3. Encouraging students to be \"key players in the educational process\" by involving them in the design and implementation of assessment and feedback practices.\n4. Creating an ongoing process of dialogue and collaboration, rather than a one-off exchange, to ensure that students are actively engaged in their learning and the assessment process.\n5. Fostering a culture of empathy and compassion, where students feel valued and respected, and where there is a shared sense of purpose and goal-orientedness.\n6. Encouraging students to take ownership of their learning and the assessment process, by providing them with choices and allowing them to have a say in how they are assessed.\n7. Providing regular and timely feedback that is constructive, specific, and actionable, and that takes into account the student's perspective and learning goals.\n8. Using technology to facilitate the assessment and feedback process, such as using online platforms to provide feedback and to enable students to track their progress.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, educators can create a more collaborative and inclusive learning environment that fosters deep learning and promotes positive emotions such as empathy and compassion."

Secondly, the engagement of individuals (learners and teachers) with evidence of learning is crucial to bring about changes in understanding. This engagement occurs within broader frameworks of learning and can happen synchronously or asynchronously. Additionally, the study found that technologies do not bring about formative effects in isolation; rather, they are one aspect of multiple processes that contribute to formative assessment. Finally, the project emphasizes the importance of understanding how technological resources can work formatively in conjunction with other social and individual cognitive resources within a coherent view of learning as \"conversational.\""
